Today's portion of the adventure was fun, I learned some things about my limits (e.g. avoid action scenes like the monster fight, that took up a whole goddamn thread, even though most of it was the 40+ responses per image), and we made some progress.\nI've been trying to give people more freedom with their actions since a lot of people were accusing me of railroading early on, so I hope that was a bit more fun as well.\n\nDon't worry, Ruby's story isn't over yet. There's still more to come, soon enough.\nThanks for your support, /tg/.",

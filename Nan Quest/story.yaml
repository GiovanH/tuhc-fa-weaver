    Nan finds herself in her bedroom. This is not unexpected.

    Nan doesn't want to get up.

    Her position is vital.

    Nan picks out some clothes for the day while reviewing her DUTY. 
    She knows she is part of a vital link in a chain of many individuals, and in order to keep things running smoothly, and to prevent catastrophe, she and all the others must stay vigilant. 
    Nan contemplates skipping her shower.

    Nan never really considered herself in terms of traits like that before. But if she had to choose one she'd probably be known for her ABILITY TO HUM SHOWTUNES. 
    Actually come to think of it Nan isn't really sure what makes her special. 

    Maybe nothing.

    Nan considers her attire. She was never fond of overalls, but she doesn't particularly care too much about how she works.

    Nan heads outside and checks her mailbox. She keeps her work orders here and just lets them pile up until she gets around to them.

    Nan gets paid per job, she's not on a salary. 

    Nan goes through the jobs she still has piling up. She momentarily considers whether she should start catching up on backlogged orders, since that's the responsible thing to do, or if she should look for something more interesting in the newer jobs.

    Someone approaches from behind a row of arcade games, giving Nan a little start. 
    The man introduces himself as the owner of the arcade. The place has power, he explains, but there's something seriously wrong with the fusebox and he can't get the place running, so he's losing profit. 

    He says the fusebox is in the basement and he'll gladly show Nan the way.

    Nan heads upstairs and tells the owner the problem is fixed. It appears he already knows. He's wasted no time attracting a crowd. Something about a live arcade just brings in kids on a saturday morning. They'd never get up this early for school.

    Nan briefly considers knocking on the door of the stranger, but she's awfully shy. She wouldn't know what to say. She doesn't even know what she'd want to say. 

    She reaches room 117, and pulls out the key she took from behind the main desk.

  "b": |-

    There's no little mint on the pillow! What kind of crass establishment is this? 
    If Nan wasn't already pretty full from pizza she'd be even more upset. Still, it would have helped get rid of pizzabreath.
  "n":

  "i": 50

  "c": "Nan: Now let's get to work on that outlet."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Nan Quest/img/51.gif[/img]

    Good thinking.  
    But this reminds Nan of a puzzle: which outlet is in need of repairs? If she replaces the wiring on the wrong one, it'll be wasted time. And if she tries one to test it, and it's the one that needs repairs, incomplete wiring could cause an electrical fire!   
    Using all the information you have already, you should be able to solve this!
  "n":
  - 52
  "i": 51
- "d": 1512414371784
  "c": "Nan: The east-facing outlet, silly!"
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Nan Quest/img/52.gif[/img]

    But which way is east?
  "n":
  - 53
  "i": 52
- "d": 1512414371784
  "c": "Nan: The sun was rising behind the hotel. It is currently to the right."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Nan Quest/img/53.gif[/img]

    Nan considers that if the sun was rising behind the hotel, and she's been going further and further back in it, then she's been heading East. Therefore East must be to the right of this room. 
    She moves the small stand and sure enough, there's another outlet on that wall. 

    Now for one final question. 
    Did the order mean "east-facing" as in "on the West wall" (facing east?) or "on the East wall" (when facing east)?
  "n":
  - 54
  "i": 53

  "c": "Nan: Check behind the dresser."
  "b": |-

  "c": "Nan: That one looks funny. Logically, it is the broken one."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Nan Quest/img/55.gif[/img]

    Nan sees what appears to be scorch marks around the outlet and decides this must be the one. She gets to work replacing the wiring (wearing safety gloves of course!) and the job appears pretty straightforward after all.
  "n":

  "i": 55

    Nan shrugs and continues her work. 
    She wonders why she assumed anyone was there. Clearly the room is empty. 

    The socket is pretty much repaired. Nan puts the finishing touches on it and replaces the outlet cover.

    That didn't take long.

    Seeing as how it hasn't been 30 minutes yet, Nan decides to practice her showtune-humming. After all, she's gotta stand out somehow.

    Nan feels an odd urge to explore the bathroom.

    It's possible they have a specialty outlet installed in the shower itself. Nan checks. 

    But there's no outlet in the shower. That means no more work here.

    Nan leans over the counter again to return the key, but the slot for Room 117 is already occupied. There is a PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER in the slot. 
    The other slots appear to be empty.

    The entire lobby begins to shake and buckle, and the chandelier rattles furiously. The pounding grows louder and louder, and like some approaching giant, closer and closer. 
    Something horrible is shaking behind that door. 
    And it may not hold.

    [color=#808080]
    Nan[/color] briefly entertains the idea of taking these items, but she's far too honest to. They might belong to someone. 
    Besides, she can't see them having any use right now!

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] examines the PENDANT. 
    It's fairly plain, made of smooth, green stone. 
    It seems somehow familiar, but [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can't put her finger on why.

    Nan is honest, but... something about this seems so strangely familiar... 
    Maybe she'll just hold onto it until she can remember what. 

    The cubbyholes for the different rooms, behind the front desk, all seem empty.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] decides to throw the pendant on for the time being, and tucks it into her shirt so it won't be noticeable. 
    Of course [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s wearing a bra. She needs support when she's on the job.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] checks her pockets. She is still carrying: 
    * The STRANGE CLOCK, still reading 4:66 PM. 
    * A PHILLIPS-HEAD SCREWDRIVER taken from the cubbyhole. 
    * The CROSSED PENDANT 
    * And a CHECK FOR REPAIRS from the FUN FAMILY ARCADE. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] goes to ring the bell.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] carefully removes the poor dead creature and wraps it as respectfully as she can in the MANAGER'S NOTE, disposing of it in the trash can behind the counter. 
    A quick clean later the bell seems ready to use again.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] decides NOT to investigate whatever's making that noise. 

    She's already on edge enough as it is, and in a panic, she bursts into [color=#808000]Henry[/color]'s room.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] blushes furiously and apologizes for barging in like that. The lights went out and she got spooked. She turns around and covers her face so she won't look. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] laughs a bit, blushing lightly himself, and suggests it must have been just the hallway, because his light's fine.

    [color=#808000]Henry [/color]tells [color=#808080]Nan[/color] he's going to slip into the bathroom for a second to finish changing. 

    He jokes that is of course unless[color=#808080] Nan[/color] would prefer he not dress, in which case she can just say so and stop barging in on him.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] answers calmly.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] jumps suddenly, pointing at the dresser. She tells [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] something has moved behind it.

    The rat, discovered, quickly scurries into the hole. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] if these things might be attacking the wiring, forcing blackouts. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says he thinks the blackouts aren't purely electrical... that he knows Nan is new here, but surely even she can tell there is more at work here than bad wiring.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] how long he's been here, and what the date and time are. 

    He says he doesn't know how long he's been here -- maybe seven or eight days. He says when he came here, it was the 14th of October, and when [color=#808080]Nan[/color] arrived it was the 24th, so he's been here for ten days. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] shrugs at her response. He says it's hard to keep track of time in this place. 

    Before [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can question more about the rathole, [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] asks her if she's hungry.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] stands, nodding. He says he is going to go to the Janitor's closet and see if there's any canned food left there. That's what he's been eating since he got here.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] grabs [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] by the shoulders and insists that he not leave her alone. There is strength in numbers, after all. If they split up, [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] could be in danger too. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] assures [color=#808080]Nan[/color] he's done this before, that he knows what this place is like. She doesn't know what she's up against yet.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] continues to insist. The only way they stand a chance is together. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] considers and finally yields. He hands [color=#808080]Nan [/color]the fire axe and tells her to keep an eye out, and to cover him if trouble arrives. 

    It's never easy. They'll wait for the lights, move quick, head straight to the janitor's closet, and head right back.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] takes the axe and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] checks the peephole. 
    He says it looks like the light is back on in the hallway.

    Nan[/color] and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] step out into the hallway again. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] freezes. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] keeps the fire axe firmly in-hand. 
    The hall light hasn't come back on. It looks like a standing light is lit, however -- though it's not standing anymore.

    He says as far as he knows they just avoid it, and if they stay...

    At the end of the hall, a slouched figure rests motionless against the wall.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] grabs the man's feet and quickly turns around. 
    A tall, dark figure is standing just in front of the light. Vaguely silhouetted, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can't quite make it out. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] shouts angrily. He tells [color=#808080]Nan[/color] to hurry and get the man into the room. He'll hold this thing off. 
    He yells at the figure. He tells it to stay away. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says he is not afraid to die anymore.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] hurries to the door, wanting to drop the unconscious figure off to safety first. 
    But just when a confrontation seems unavoidable, the tall figure steps out of the light, disappearing back into the darkness beyond.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] help the unconscious man onto the bed. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] confirms what she's suspected: the man is [color=#808000]Henry[/color]. He's still alive, and doesn't beat any visible wounds as far as she can tell.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color]'s voice is very quiet. He says he doesn't know why they are still alive. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks again, if it's true that those things don't enter the light. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says that thing was not like the others. 

    He says that was [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color]. 
    And he's never seen [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] just... [b]leave[/b].

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks about [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color], wanting to take the opportunity to learn what she can. [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says he was told to come in as the janitor here -- thus, why he has the key to the closet. But he didn't even get to meet the manager before he found himself trapped here, just like [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks about [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color], how he knows its name. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says that thing may not have a name. It's some... thing that's dressed up like a Padre, so that's what he calls it. And it's not usually the type to leave. 
    He says in his time here he's also seen a few other beings that stood out from uninvited husks, those knotted masses of blackened flesh. He picked up the names from [color=#800000]Alan[/color], another he found trapped here, who had been here far longer. 
    There's something... a man in a black robe. [color=#800000]Alan[/color] called it [color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color]. And something he always called the Beast -- but [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says he never saw it.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] ponders quietly a moment and shows [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] the cross-shaped pendant and alarm clock, but they mean nothing to[color=#2020f0] Pablo.[/color] 

    Finally, she asks if he's tried breaking a window to escape. 
    He says yes, the first thing everyone tries is to go out the doors and windows. But they'll always just end up back in the hotel. The only windows that lead anywhere are the ones that open to the courtyard, and [color=#800000]Alan[/color] said that's where the Beast sleeps.

    He says yes. It seems the uninvited things can die, just like anyone. But he's not sure about the others -- [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color], [color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color]... 

    He slowly, cautiously approaches behind the dresser. 

    There is a rat in the hole, again. 
    ...and something else.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] gives [color=#2020f0]Henry[/color] a brief look over, but he has no visible wounds she can discern. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] seems to be having trouble getting the can open. He mentions that the can-opener is in the Janitor's closet. Still.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s not particularly hungry, but [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says he is. He hasn't eaten in two days or more, by his count, though again he admits he has a poor grasp of how time passes here. 

    On that note, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] has any plans for escape. He says he's given it some thought but has been busy enough just trying to stay alive that he doesn't have a plan yet. All he knows is the front door is out of the question.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] offers to use the axe but [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] is reluctant. He says it will get beans everywhere. 

    After a moment he says if she's going to do that, at least do it over the sink, so they don't lose more food than necessary. Every bean counts!

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] brings the can to the sink so she'll have a working surface, then cleverly punctures a hole in the lid with the spike.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] hands the open can over to [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color], who is grateful, then places the clock on the ground.

    The light returns in an instant, a harsh, dusky orange glare, and [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] suddenly finds herself someplace new. 

    A fire is roaring in the corner, burning up spilled alcohol and wooden chairs piled there. The blaze is spreading, and filling the air with thick black smoke!

    This appears to be some sort of lounge, judging by the stacked chairs and tables, as well as the glasses and drinks by the bar, and the thick cloth napkins on the countertop. 

    The smoke is getting thicker and [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] coughs as she shoves aside the broken chair from the double doors. 

    [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] can't use her shirt as a filter, as it's fastened into her overalls!

    Startled, [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] lashes out with the axe, hacking the blade into the blackened hand grasping the extinguisher. She severs two fingers, but also ruptures the extinguisher, and the force of the sudden decompression expels massive amounts of the smothering contents and knocks [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] backwards. She staggers and leans against the countertop for support, scattering cloth napkins. 

    The fire continues to rage, and the smoke is growing thicker. [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] is coughing badly.

    The door is slammed shut on [color=#af5000]Nan[/color]'s face just as she realizes her situation. She wheels around, axe readied, but whoever -- or whatever -- stands behind her grabs the handle firmly. 

    It stands before her, so close she can feel its ragged, uneven breath. But in the dense smoke, it's hard to make out the figure exactly. 

    It says nothing. It merely raises a clawed hand.

    [color=#af5000]Nan[/color] spins around, avoiding a swift raking claw from the horrible figure. But when she makes to wrench the axe away, the figure responds in kind and with surprising strength sends it clattering across the floor.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] throws the axe at the figure in a last-ditch attempt to slow it down, but the gesture is hardly effective. 

    Given the thing's reaction to fire, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] puts aside any thought of fighting it and bursts from the room, re-entering the HOTEL LOBBY. Black smoke pours from the doors. 

    Up ahead, she can just make out someone moving down the hall away from her.

    Nan hurries after the shambling figure ahead, but glancing into the elevator... 

    Someone's calling to Nan! 
    The voice says they thought they missed their chance, and to hurry up and get in the elevator, quick!

    The stranger offers her a hand, helping her up. 

    She says it's very nice to meet [color=#808080]Nan[/color], and introduces herself as [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]. 
    She asks with a joking smile if those dark, half-melted fellows running around are friends of hers.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] staggers up, struggling for questions. She wants to know exactly what's going on. 
    Actually, [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] interrupts, she was hoping [color=#808080]Nan[/color] would tell her.

    The elevator is rising. The destination is the third floor.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] tries to stay collected, but after what she's been through, she's shaking and scared. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] places a hand reassuringly on her shoulder and tells her she will feel better once she meets everyone.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks who "everyone" is and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] says it would be better if she met them in person. 

    The HOTEL ELEVATOR arrives at the THIRD FLOOR LANDING. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] checks the hall in both directions, and it appears well-lit and empty. She asks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] to come along.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] checks her pockets. She is carrying a BALLPOINT PEN, PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER, CROSS PENDANT, MAGNIFYING GLASS, and an UNCASHED CHECK. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks a few nervous questions, but [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] doesn't know of any significance behind "4:66". 
    She also says she has spent one night here in the hotel. So this would be her second day here. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] arrive at ROOM 313. A cross is scrawled on the door. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] knocks three times and identifies herself, saying she's arrived with a guest and needs to be let in.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] inspects the strange wooden carving by the door, and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] heads inside, beckoning [color=#808080]Nan[/color] to follow.

    Here there are three other people. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] goes around introducing them to [color=#808080]Nan[/color], from left to right: A stocky middle aged man in a worn brown hat named [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]. [color=#808000]Henry[/color] -- who [color=#808080]Nan[/color] recognizes. And lastly, a young woman in glasses that [color=#808080]Anna[/color] introduces as [color=#088000]Kim[/color]. 

    The room is dirty and the painting on the back wall is torn apart, but this place seems to be stocked with a few provisions, cans of food and bottles of water.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] introduces herself and [color=#808000]Henry[/color] says now that everyone's here, they might as well go over some information. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] interjects and says there's still one more person around here somewhere, but he went out against advisement -- sort of a strange fellow. She didn't get his name. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] appends that [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] is still out there somewhere, but after giving [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] his description, she says the person in question must not have been [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color]. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] seems as eager for answers as anyone, and begins by introducing herself: She's been here for one night. She came here to respond to an ad about a job available as an elevator operator in the hotel, but found herself trapped after coming inside. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] tells her story: She's an electrician who came here to fix an outlet, and after that couldn't leave. 
    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] explains that he is a businessman who was traveling and had to stop here for the night. He had barely unpacked when he ran into Nan and came to realize their situation. He's been here about as long as [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] speaks calmly, telling her tale. She is a college student from a nearby town that [color=#808080]Nan[/color] recognizes, who was passing through on her way home. She stopped at the hotel in the night and was likewise trapped. She's been trapped here an entire week. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says he is an ex-US Marshall. He came to stay at the hotel just to see it, since it just recently went up. But he ran into the same troubles. He's been here for two weeks.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] are both full of questions. Together they ask if anyone knows what's going on, but are met only with silence. It seems the whole of the situation is still out of grasp. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks what [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] knows -- where he's been getting food, how he's been staying alive. He responds simply, and his voice is gravelly: He's been going to the janitor's closet and the kitchen to get food and water when necessary. Somehow they haven't run out yet. He stays in the light and doesn't let his guard down. That's how he's still alive -- because he's not about to die here, in this place. Not without even knowing what it is. 



    There is a long silence. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] speaks almost in a whisper and suggests that perhaps he is already dead. Perhaps they all are, and this is hell. Or heaven. 
    At this point, she asks, would they even know the difference?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says that before she came here, she went to the arcade, fixed some electric wiring, then came here and had pizza. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] insists [color=#808080]Nan[/color] consider her story. How was she eating the pizza? Is that the last thing that happened while coming here? Could she have choked?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] explains that on consideration, she was eating the pizza while riding her bike. She checked the work order briefly. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] suddenly points. 
    She announces that must be it. She was riding her bike down a busy street, while eating pizza AND reading. It would only have taken a split second of distraction and she could have been struck by an automobile. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is about to insist that she would remember such a thing when [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] speaks up. He says there's another problem with [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s story: This town doesn't have an arcade. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s memory feels hazy. Surely she would have remembered an incident like that? But then... she's starting to have trouble keeping things clear. She remembers [color=#808000]Henry[/color], somehow, but... was it even real?

    So far everyone has described coming from the same town in their stories. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] interrupts [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] and corrects him, saying there IS an arcade. She's been going there for years. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] replies that if there was a penny arcade in town he'd know. 

    A very sickly feeling crawls up from [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s stomach. 
    She turns and asks very slowly what year everyone thinks this is.

    There's a long pause as everyone seems to wonder if [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is serious. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] finally speaks up with a shrug. 

    She says it's 1936.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks everyone what year it was when they came here. She starts by saying she arrived in December of 2009. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] appends by saying they should also list the last thing they remember prior to all this weirdness starting. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] says the year is 1936. May. She went into the hotel but no one was around, so she used the elevator to get a feel for it. It started making strange noises, then the lights went out, and when they came on she felt like something was chasing her, so she fled. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] nods quietly and mutters something about the elevator to herself. 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says the year is 1912, late July. The hotel was still partially under construction when he arrived, after several years of going up. He passed by some carpenters and laborers, all working busily as he entered the hotel. As soon as he stepped inside, he knew something was wrong. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] asks if anyone was on scaffolding where he passed, and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says yes. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] says it is June of 1946. As he said, he was out on business when he stopped here. No one was at the front desk and he was exhausted, so he grabbed a key and took a room. He drew a bath, relaxed in it, and just as he closed his eyes he heard someone in his room -- [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] asks if he was tired enough to fall asleep. Henry shrugs. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] nods again and wraps up with herself: 2016. August. The last thing she remembers is tripping over the threshold while coming inside. She says hit her head pretty bad. 
    Worse than she thought, maybe.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] grills [color=#088000]Kim[/color] on a few more details: Why would the hotel have already been empty then? Why would they have come here, especially in [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s case, where she would have "died" outside the hotel? What happened to the people who SHOULD be here? 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] shrugs under [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s barrage of questions and calmly explains that she doesn't have all the answers -- in a place like this, who could? -- but she's doing her best to piece it together. It doesn't seem logical or rational, but nothing about this hotel does. They may as well be in hell right now. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if she or anyone else has seen [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] or any other guests. [color=#808000]Henry[/color] says he ran into [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] briefly, but didn't get his story.

    HEY! 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] tells everyone to wake the fuck up. She was just chased by a horrible monster from a burning room into a visage of herself, so if anyone should be having a total fucking meltdown right now, it's her. But she's too damn preoccupied with getting out to worry about what the hell is going on with the years or whether or not they're dead. All that matters right now is that they're here, and they need to not be here. The only way that'll happen is if they all work together. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if anyone knows where [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] or the other guest absent are.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] takes a small puff from his cigar and nods quietly by the wall. 
    He says he saw [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] the first time about a week and a half ago. He seems a little suspicious, but what doesn't in this god-forsaken place? He says the other man is named [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]. He doesn't seem to want to stick with the group though, but he'll probably be out on the second floor. That's where he said he was going. 
    He also saw [color=#800000]Alan[/color], who was later found carved to pieces by [color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color]. 

    Oh, he says, he knows [color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color]. And [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color]. And the Beast. Doesn't know much about them, but he's seen them. Knows they're not on the same side. Stay far away. 
    If you see the Beast, he tells [color=#808080]Nan[/color], just run. Just run, and don't stop.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] begins to formulate a plan of action. She restates that no matter what the nature of this place -- whether they're dead or alive -- none of that matters. This place is clearly not good and they need to get out now. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] what he knows about this place. He's been here the longest, he must have some insight. 

    He takes a puff and begins. 
    The Hotel was built only recently, at least for him, he says. The spot of land it was built on has been open for a long time. Before that, when he was a kid, he remembers the remnants of a Spanish Mission, but it was gone long before. 
    As for the place itself, it's hard to understand. Everything seems to be moving around and changing. It's hard to rely on anything. He says he's tried the doors and windows enough times to know they don't open, except to lead somewhere you probably don't want to be. But never out. 
    The courtyard at the center of the hotel has some windows opening to it but he's never tried crossing over into it, because that's where the Beast lives. A huge animal, as black as night, feral and vicious. Cold and unthinking. It comes into the Hotel sometimes -- he's seen it twice inside now, he says. 
    He states again light seems to be their only true defense from the three primary threats here. 
    He's stockpiled some food here from the kitchen and janitor's closet, and they have little in the way of defense. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] has a kitchen knife, [color=#088000]Kim[/color] has a taser she brought here, [color=#808000]Henry[/color] has a club made from a chair leg, and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] himself carries a revolver with a few shots remaining. 
    As for [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s inquiry about items, he says that he has a few, and no offense intended to the little lady, but he feels more comfortable holding onto them himself than giving them to a stranger.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says it's not going to matter much, and as long as the lights are on she's been able to sleep just fine for the week that she's been here. But if it would make [color=#808080]Nan[/color] feel better, she's willing to lose a little sleep.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] quickly considers the bathroom, and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] volunteers to check. He examines it for a moment, then calls an all-clear. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] agrees with [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s decision -- she'll take first shift. She's not good at waking up but many late nights at college have made her adept at staying up. 
    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] volunteers for the following shift.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] cautions the others to stay close, in case there's danger, then leans out the door to peer into the hall. 

    But there's no sign of [color=#a00000]Anna[/color].

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] takes the DECORATIVE TOTEM and returns to the room. She tells the others that there's no sign of [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] and asks what the plans are for a rescue party. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] immediately speaks up and is opposed to the idea. She explains that [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] may be new, but she knows the risks and shouldn't go wandering off on her own. If they follow after her, they're risking their own lives. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] speculates that it may not be safe, but he wouldn't feel right about leaving her behind. He thinks a rescue party is a good idea. 
    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] agrees. He says he's willing to go if Nan is.

    All right, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says. If they have to split up, [color=#088000]Kim[/color] and [color=#808000]Henry[/color] can stay, [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] will come along. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] asks if he can come along instead. He says he and [color=#808080]Nan[/color] are in this together, and he wants to go with her. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] agrees, saying she would feel safer with [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] around anyway. 

    She quietly adds that it makes sense to stay behind, because if something happens to the room, their only safe area, they'll all be in trouble. 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says he's fine with either decision, but they should make it quickly. Every second they waste debating is another second [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] is out there on her own.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] lends [color=#808000]Henry[/color] her TASER and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] lends [color=#808080]Nan[/color] an old-fashioned OIL LANTERN. 

    From the collective supply [color=#808080]Nan[/color] also takes a piece of rebar which has been ground and filed on one side to make a REBAR SWORD. It's still primarily a blunt weapon but it'll have a bit more punch. 

    They step out into the hall and [color=#808080]Anderson[/color] says he'll be watching the door in case they need to re-enter in a hurry. 
    And good luck. 

    Nan and Henry step out into the hall. The way to the right just leads to a dead end. The left leads down the hall and around the corner, where Nan came from. There is also a window on the wall opposite the door, and a stairwell leading down near the corner.

    The taser is a simple short-range type, and [color=#808000]Henry[/color] says he already knows how to use it. It seems simple enough. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] recommends heading for the corner and checking the hall down where the elevator is, then trying the stairs, if there's nothing there. 
    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] agrees, and together they walk in silence, slowly. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] speaks up after a few moments. 
    He asks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] somewhat hesitantly if they've ever met before. Like... before the hotel. 
    He normally never forgets a face, but his memory feels strangely hazy here. And yet, there's something so familar about her.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] responds she has memories of him, but they're so strange... as though she can't tell whether they're real or just a product of this place. It's weird, but -- 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and [color=#808000]Henry[/color] peer down the darkened corner of the hotel hallway.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] stays back to observe a moment, but [color=#808000]Henry[/color] suddenly rushes forward, yelling [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]'s name. 
    The figure by the elevator does not respond to [color=#808000]Henry[/color]'s call.

    A clawed hand comes from behind and clamps tightly over [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s mouth, dragging her roughly into the darkened stairwell. She drops the lantern on the floor by the landing, but it does not break. 

    A hoarse, scratchy voice whispers breathily in her ear. Something very sharp glints in the darkness, less than an inch from [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s face. 
    The voice says that if she does not stay quiet, she will get her little throat slit wide open before she can get out two words. 

    The figure in the dark pauses for a moment, as if waiting for [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s reaction.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] nods quietly and she's pulled back suddenly, a bit further into the darkness. The hoarse whispery voice speaks again, closer this time. She can feel hot breath against her ear. 

    The dry male voice says good. 
    He says he is going to ask a few questions and wants answers and no bullshit, or he will kill her. He wants answers. 

    Who is she? What is her name? 
    Why is she here? 
    How long has she been here? 
    What does she intend to do here? 
    He says to answer quick and she won't get hurt. All he wants is answers. 

    He removes his hand slowly but keeps the sharp instrument near her neck. 
    And don't try to scream, he says.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] answers obediently.
    Her name is [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. She's a repairwoman who was called to fix an outlet. Then she found she couldn't leave. 
    She's been here less than a day, as far as she can tell. 
    And she plans to [b]leave[/b]. 

    There's a long, tense pause, and then a click as the sharp implement is drawn away from [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s throat. The clawed hands release her slowly. 
    A scratching sound is followed by a sudden flare of light as the figure in the dark lights a match. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] turns to look. 

    The strange man quietly introduces himself as [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]. 
    His hands aren't clawed after all -- he's just ungroomed and his fingernails have grown long. 
    He gives [color=#808080]Nan[/color] an odd look and asks why she would want to leave. Doesn't she know what this place is?

    As [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] pockets his switchblade, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] hesitates, then answers no, she doesn't know what this place is. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins broadly and gestures out grandly. He says HE does. 

    Everyone has a theory on this place. Everyone wants to KNOW, he says. They want to know too [b]much[/b]. That won't do them any good. 

    He says [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] thinks this place is like a mystery, like a dream. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says this place is hell. 
    But Santiago says he knows. 

    This place is [b]freedom[/b]. 
    Out there, there are rules. There are laws. There are morals. People fear God. 
    But in here, there is no right and wrong. And there is no God. There is only us. There is only what we do and what we feel. This is the absolute. This is freedom. This is a world, at long last, of man's design. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] and the others think they know so much about the world. But not this place. Maybe [color=#808080]Nan[/color] thinks she knows too, but she's wrong. She has to forget that and just go with it. 
    Forget about everything you may never be able to know. Forget about if anything you do is anything good, or anything bad. Forget about if what you're doing is what you "should". 

    This place is the ultimate freedom. 
    So he asks, why would [b]anyone[/b]... want to [b]leave[/b]?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] responds nervously that as well and good as that may be, it's not worth people trying to kill her. 

    Oh, asks [color=#400080]Santiago[/color], and what's so bad about death? 

    He leans in closer. 
    He says a girl named [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] arrived the other day. She has an interesting idea about this place. 
    Does [color=#808080]Nan[/color] know what [color=#a00000]Anna [/color]thinks? 
    She thinks everyone is here for a reason. That this is a prison they've all earned themselves a sentence in, through their own actions. Some horrible thing they've done. Some sin they've committed. 
    They're trapped here only by their own design. That this is their [b]punishment[/b]. 
    Maybe [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] [b]wants[/b] to be punished, [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] says through his teeth. Maybe she thinks she deserves it so much, that's what she's waiting for. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] scoots back uncomfortably, and [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins, leaning close to her ear. 
    He whispers another question in a hoarse voice. 
    "[color=#400080]And what about you, Nan? What's your sin?[/color]"

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] insists she has no idea what her sin is, and that she considers herself a generally okay person. Besides, didn't [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] just say there are no sins in this place? 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins even wider and lets out an amused gasp. Evidently he and [color=#808080]Nan[/color] are on the same page, he says. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]'s theory is baseless. It's only a product of her own desire to be punished. Maybe she should be punished.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] glances back at the stairwell door. 
    She tells [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] politely that it's been nice meeting him but she really should get back to the group. 
    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grabs [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s arm lightly and asks if she's really going so soon. As long as she's here, wouldn't she rather stay and see the kind of fun truly free people can have in the dark?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says she's... got to get going at the moment. She has a lot of thinking to do. As she turns, a light flickers into the stairwell from the hall above. 

    A voice calls out to [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. [color=#808000]Henry[/color]'s voice. He's asking if she's there.

    With a fizzling sound he extinguishes his match, leaving only a faint plume of dark smoke hanging in the air. He steps back down the stairwell, disappearing into the darkness. 

    He says to be patient. He says next time, he'll have some real fun with her.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is torn between running away with the sick feeling in her stomach or forcing a wave goodbye, but [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] has already left. [color=#808080]Henry[/color] appears in the doorway a moment later, shining his flashlight in. 

    He seems relieved to see [color=#808080]Nan[/color] hasn't gone far. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says she ran into [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] and [color=#808000]Henry[/color] pales a little. She says he seems to be at home in the darkness. 
    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] says perhaps he found a way to live in the dark safely. From what he heard, [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]'s been here for almost a whole month. 

    He turns to [color=#a00000]Anna[/color], who stands quietly beside him. He says she was just waiting by the elevator, staring into it. 
    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] very quietly explains she thought she heard someone calling her.

    He says the room went pitch black and he didn't have a light source. He called out for her, but she wouldn't answer. He opened the door to the hall hoping to let some light in, but then he remembered the power was still off out there. Before he could close the door, something attacked him in the darkness, and he woke up in the shared room. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] follows quietly.

    The pendant bears a striking resemblance to [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s own, but when she checks her pockets, it's gone. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] explains her own ordeals, but it's so disjointed, like a dream that's hard to explain. [color=#808000]Henry[/color] seems to get the gist of it though and says he's just relieved that [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is all right after all that. 

    The group returns to the room where [color=#088000]Kim [/color]and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] are waiting. Everyone is glad [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] is back safe. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] quietly stares at the floor and says they're not going to get out of here. 
    And maybe they don't deserve to.

    They're trapped here, and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] can't help but feel there's a reason. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks that if they're all here for a reason, what did [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] do to deserve it? 

    She's quiet for a moment, then answers that she's not about to say what -- but it's there. She's got her bad thing, and she'd bet that so does everyone else here. 

    She nods to [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] as an example. 
    How many times do you think he's fired that gun? 
    Has he killed anyone? 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says of course he has. He's a US Marshall. Sometimes it's part of the job.

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] interjects on [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s behalf, excusing the Marshall. He says it's sometimes necessary for a lawman to kill if innocent lives are endangered. But upholding the law and murder are two different things. 
    And surely, [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s never killed an innocent man. 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] scowls and speaks gruffly.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is fed up with everyone being a downer! She tells [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] that whether or not they "deserve" to be here doesn't make a difference now. If [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] just wants to sit in the corner and wallow in self-pity that's her choice, but [color=#808080]Nan[/color] isn't about to give up. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] smirks oddly and corrects [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. 
    She clarifies that she never said she was giving up. If they're here by their own actions, that means they can leave by their own actions, too. 

    And [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] for one doesn't plan to die in a place like this. She's getting the hell out of here first, and sorting out her absolution later.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] lets [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] in and he promptly notices [color=#808080]Nan[/color] with pleasant surprise. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says that after she smashed that thing in his room everything went black and when the lights came back on a few seconds later, she was gone. He'd feared the worst, but evidently she's all right. And now she's here with everyone else, to boot. He thought he might not see her again.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] raises her hand and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] eyes it strangely, but with a quick gesture and a little encouragement they high-five, if a little awkwardly. [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] smiles. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks him what year it is.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] gives [color=#808080]Nan[/color] an even stranger look and after a pause he seems to decide she must be serious. 
    He says it's still 1966, right?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] sits [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] down and informs him of the strange effect this place has on their relative "home" times. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] glances around in confusion for a moment, but the others nod to confirm [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s explanation. He settles down for a minute without saying anything, then asks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] if people are living on the moon yet, in her time. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says no. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says not in her time either. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] seems a little disappointed, but otherwise largely unphased by this revelation.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says they need a plan. They should combine knowledge, maybe work on a map. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] agrees. [color=#088000]Kim[/color] does too, but she says it's far too late to concentrate on things like that. They should start thinking about sleep. 
    Now that there are six of them, they can take 3 shifts of 2 people each. Everyone can get a few hours of sleep.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says she'll take the first shift. She's not as reliable at getting up early but she can pull late nights no problem. It's part of the college schedule. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] sympathizes. She's never been much of an early riser and hates interrupted sleep. She sleeps in late on weekends. And weekdays too, usually. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says he's staying up with [color=#088000]Kim[/color]. She's the youngest and if anyone needs him for backup, she does. [color=#088000]Kim[/color] doesn't object. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] asks no one in particular who should take the other shifts. 

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] suggests jokingly that they should have mixed shifts, so there's no point where all the girls are asleep, since who knows what trouble the men would get up to. 
    But she apologizes sheepishly after nobody laughs.

    That leaves [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] in the middle shift. They accept as well. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] rises from the bed and offers it to the others, but everyone is too polite to take the bed.

    And yet, settling in, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] realizes how tired she really is. 

    She lies down, closes her eyes, and tries to sleep.

    Nan is in a strange place. There are no real furnishings around except for these tall, strange installments that look like badly stretched canvas. She stands in a long, darkened white hallway that leads to a larger but just as unfurnished room on one side and a narrow doorway on the other, from which steady light is pouring.

    Nan peers into the next room. There are six more canvases here. 
    Only one bears a silhouette. 

    And... something else.
  "n":

    Nan stops for a moment and watches. 
    She quietly calls out "[color=#808080]Hello?[/color]" 

    The figure on the floor has definitely noticed her. Something about the room's atmosphere changes very suddenly. 

    Something on the canvas moves.

    Nan runs towards the light. The darkness begins to recede behind her as the narrow doorway rushes up.

    Nan suddenly bursts through the doorway and emerges in a cold white room full of light. 

    Pablo is here. 
    He is making soft sobbing sounds.
  "n":

    There is no door to the hallway Nan just came from. 

    Nan quietly says Pablo's name, hoping to get a response. Immediately he snaps up, pulling his head away from his hands, which are soaked with blood. He stares at Nan for a long moment, then begins to speak. 

    His voice is shaky and breaks intermittently as he speaks. 
    He says [color=#2020f0]Hello, baby. 
    Are you coming back now? 
    [/color]He says[color=#2020f0] I'm sorry. 
    I'm so sorry. 
    Can you ever forgive me? 
    Can you ever forgive me for what I did?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is torn between fight and flight. Her options are limited: She's by no means a fighter, but the only door out of this hall is past this ragged figure. She must take a stand, but afraid of getting close, she compromises. 
    Steeling her will, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] reels back with her sharpened piece of rebar and prepares to hurl it at the oncoming monstrosity.

    It's a lucky throw! The sharpened edge of the REBAR SWORD buries itself deep in the monster's skull, sending bone fragments flying!

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] throws questions at the approaching monster. Why did it kill [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]? Why is it doing this? What is this place? 
    But the creature does not seem in a talkative mood. 

    [color=#b0b000][b]NO. STOP TALKING. 
    NO QUESTIONS, PLEASE. 
    YOU HAVE TO DIE. 
    YOU NEED TO RELEASE ME. [/b][/color]

    The creature wields its knife menacingly and begins shambling towards [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. Clearly it is not waiting for permission. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] considers rushing the monster with the table, but on reconsideration decides to just flee. 
    She runs to the end of the hall. The window appears to be unlocked, and she begins to force it open as the creature approaches.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] edges over to the nearest window carefully.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] looks out over the courtyard in the center of the hotel. It doesn't open to the outside, so it's hard to see anything but more of the hotel -- but it appears much larger than she first imagined. 
    It's too dark to make much of anything out though, save for a few distant lit windows. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] could swear she sees dark shapes intermittently pass by them. 

    As she observes the courtyard, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] draws her screwdriver, thinking to unlatch the window with it. 
    But the window is suddenly thrown open and a hand grabs her wrist tightly in the darkness.

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] helps [color=#808080]Nan[/color] inside, where he welcomes her to the SUNSET ROOM. 
    It seems much larger inside than it did from the outside. An old fashioned PIANO sits in the corner, and there are tables, chairs, stools, and an old ripped up painting. A single door leads out. 
    The room is well-lit. And yet there don't appear to be any visible light sources.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says that she's glad all the same, and [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] begins to play the piano. 

    The tune is strangely beautiful yet discordant. It's clear [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] really knows how to play, but the melody is as uncontrollable and unpredictable as its creator. 

    Something about the music makes [color=#808080]Nan[/color] feel very uncomfortable. Her stomach knots up. 
    She uneasily begins to explain about what happened -- about [color=#a00000]Anna[/color], and the creature that pursued her. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] responds, but doesn't stop playing. 
    He says [color=#808080]Nan[/color] shouldn't worry her pretty little head about it.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks for the whereabouts of her other friends. [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] says he doesn't know. He only just got here himself. No one around but her. And [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks what he means, about [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] wanting to die. How he could tell. 
    He says he can always tell. 
    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] says he could always see it in her eyes. Through the terror, through the fear, he knew. 
    Don't cry for her. 
    She had to be put down, you see. 
    At least she had a purpose.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks what [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] thinks her purpose is. He keeps playing and says he wants to talk about something else now. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks about the music. [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] asks her if she likes it. He only just wrote it. 
    It's called "[color=#a00000]Anna[/color]", in memoriam of the most recently deceased guest. He says he was inspired by her lovely screams for mercy. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] stares out the window into the courtyard. 
    At the ground floor, something stares back.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] if he really just got here. He seems knowledgeable enough. 

    He laughs, still playing. No, he says, he only just got HERE, in the Sunset Room. He's been in this hotel much, much longer. It was 1986 when he got here, and yet only a month or so has passed. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks about the Beast and [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins, suggesting she leave it alone and stay away from the window. She wouldn't want to get it riled up. 

    To avoid upsetting him, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says she likes the music. [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins and nods. He says good. 
    Maybe he'll write one for [color=#808080]Nan[/color] next.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if there have been others. 
    Oh yes, [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] says. And they all screamed quite beautifully. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]'s plans for her song involve her dying. 
    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins. 
    He says everyone has to die, sooner or later. 
    [color=#808080]
    Nan[/color] is unnerved and just comes right out with it: She ask how she knows she can trust [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]. 
    He laughs and says she can't. 
    She says she doesn't know if he will hurt her. 
    He laughs even louder and says he doesn't know either. 
    But that's what makes it so [b]exciting[/b]. 

    He goes back to playing after a pause. 
    Besides, he says, if she really wants something to be afraid of, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] should go look in a mirror.

    At [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s asking, [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] explains he came here in December of 1986. 
    When she asks about the skeletal figure, he grins. That bag of bones, he says, is what [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] and the others call [color=#b0b000][b]the Pilgrim[/b][/color]. [b][color=#b0b000]The Pilgrim[/color][/b]'s smart. Looks out for himself, he says. He only does what he wants. Just like [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]. Smart. 
    This place is freedom. No authority. No God. No one to answer to. No right and wrong. Do what you want to do. 
    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] grins, still playing. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] agrees, doesn't she? She said she did. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] shifts into a simple but quick-tempo portion of his musical piece, and without breaking the beat, holds out one hand. 

    "Give me your hand."

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] gives [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] her hand and he finally stops playing. The room is uncomfortably silent. 
    After a moment, he glances up at her, gripping her hand. 

    He asks why she gave her hand to him. 
    She is free. She could have done anything. And he is free too. He could do anything with her hand, and [color=#808080]Nan[/color] has no way of knowing what that is. And yet she gave him her hand. 

    He smiles, seeming quite amused, and asks why.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says she gave him her hand as a sign of trust, and now it's his choice to do with that trust as he will. He has no obligation -- and neither does she. 
    In the end, it was because she wanted to. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] nearly screams. 
    YES! 
    Yes, that's it, he says, teeth bared in a hysterical grin. He brings his other hand up, which grips his opened switchblade. 
    That's freedom! That's true freedom! 
    To resist or submit! To kill or to die! To cut off someone's fingers one by one! 
    And you know what? He doesn't even want to do that anymore. Not right now! 

    He's so happy he wants to do something NICE for Nan. Because it would make [b]him[/b] happier.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] for advice on how to move safely in the darkness. He laughs hysterically and says there is no way to move safely here, especially not in the darkness. 

    As if on cue, the lights go out. 
    Only the dimmest light from the courtyard filters into the room, and [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]'s eerie song begins again. 

    He says the lights go out all the time. When they get angry, especially. When they become disturbed. In fact, in the time he's been here, it seems like any time you go against the Hotel, it will do what it can to stop you. And the first step is always to cut the lights -- because that's when the really bad things get free roam. Like the Beast. And [color=#82004a]Father[/color]. 
    The best way to keep the lights on is not to make waves, but what's the fun in that? 

    There is no moving safely in the dark, he says. You just have to learn not to be afraid. Not because the things there can't hurt you... because they can. Oh, they certainly can. Especially [color=#82004a]Father[/color]. 

    But you're free to move, just as you're free to die. 
    That's how he can live in the dark. He doesn't fear death. He is free in the darkness. He is not afraid. 
    Little by little, just letting it become a part of himself.

    They're here. 

    We'd better move, if we want to stay alive, he says.

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] rushes to the door and slams it open. The faintest light from the hall helps [color=#808080]Nan[/color] follow after, hurrying through the darkness. Vague shapes move around her, and she can hear that same ragged, heavy breathing. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] emerges in the hall, and notices the light is coming from an old-fashioned oil lantern with the flame dialed way down. Another set of eyes gleam in the darkness to her right. 
    Santiago appears to be a rather fast runner.

    When the glare fades, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] finds herself someplace new. A few men in strange uniform move purposefully about the TERRA COTTA COURTYARD. 

    The warm scent of flowers rises in the summer heat. 

    The sun is out. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] had forgotten how comforting its light was.

    [img]assets://mspfa/Nan Quest/img/307.gif[/img]

    No, it doesn't seem like heaven -- but it is quite peaceful. 
    Beneath the warm summer sun, the TERRA COTTA COURTYARD is full of figures moving about, all connecting into other parts of what appears to be a SPANISH MISSION. It seems quite well maintained, with no signs of age. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] approaches the man in the black hood and poncho who seats himself by the bells, says hello, and asks for information.
  "n":

  "c": "Nan: Ask hooded man for information."
  "b": |-

    The man rests on the stone bench and pulls back his black cloth hood before smiling at [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and nodding quietly. 

    Of course, he says, what can this humble traveler do to help?
  "n":

    Though she tries not to react strongly, the man in the black hood notices her reaction and points to his scar, explaining that it's not important. It's from a long time ago. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks for the date -- including the year. The man smiles, looking up at the warm sky and the sun-baked adobe and tile roof of the building by the courtyard, and says that he understands. In a place like this, it must be so easy to lose track of time. 
    He's just passing through, himself. Here to see someone, and then move on. And yet he wishes he could stay in this lovely place, so long that he too could lose track of the years. 

    It is the third -- or wait, perhaps the fourth? -- of June, in the year 1828.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks the man in the black hood his name, and offers her own. He introduces himself politely as [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color]. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks who he's here to see, and he says before he passes through on his way North, he'd like to speak with [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] and get his blessing.

    He comments that it doesn't appear [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] is going to be coming to them, so [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] dons his black hood and stands, offering Nan his hand. 

    But... everything is going dark. The warm sunlight is receding.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] reaches out, but [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] and the courtyard are already gone. 

    In the darkness, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can only see [color=#400080]Santiago[/color], who looms over her, holding the dimmed lantern. 

    He says [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is on her own now, and he's going to take the lantern. 
    He'd love to stay and have more fun with her, but it's not a good time to stay in one place.

    As he runs off into the darkness, disappearing from sight, he calls back to her. 
    He says she's quite mistaken. There's no need to apologize. 
    After all, whatever she saw, it's [b]her[/b] problem. Not his.

    Santiago[/color] has run off, taking the lantern with him, leaving [color=#808080]Nan[/color] in the darkness of the third floor hall, just outside the Sunset Room. 

    The heavy, ragged breathing and shuffling footsteps have gone quiet. All that remains is silence, and the placeless echo of [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s vision of the TERRA COTTA COURTYARD.

    After they woke up [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] for their shift, they took a short nap, then headed out to look for Santiago. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] groans. That means [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] could be dead too.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] says nothing. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] explains her ordeal after waking up, how she was chased and led around. [color=#088000]Kim[/color] asks what part of that constitutes a "space-time" oddity, if she just moved around. 

    Finally, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] suggests they take the elevator back to the safe room. [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] replies that the safe room is on the third floor. Where they already are.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says she has a key to something called the Anasazi Lounge. She found it in her room, when she first got here. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can have it -- [color=#088000]Kim[/color] doesn't even know where the Lounge is.

    On the wall of the elevator is a figure vaguely resembling a person.

    The doors open. 
    The lights appear to be on out in the hall.

    Below is a dirty, old elevator shaft. The elevator car sits at the bottom. But given the proportions, it doesn't feel like the same elevator. 
    [color=#808080]
    Nan[/color] walks over and asks [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] what she's doing, but [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] is too busy with her work to respond. 

    A voice comes from below, distant and echoing. The source cannot be seen. The voice asks [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] if she's done yet. 
    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] replies that she is almost done. She calls the voice "Mr. Bowerman".

    [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] rummages past it, then picks it up, commenting that it appears she did have a spare, after all.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] examines the SEASIDE PAINTING. 
    It depicts some sort of very primitive looking building made of stone, or perhaps clay, standing on a cliff by the seaside. A strange tower, perhaps some kind of lighthouse, stands beside it with a great bonfire burning atop it. 
    The majority of the painting is dominated by a very bleak and very gray sea.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] squints against the hazy darkness and shines her flashlight up into the thick smoke that lingers overhead. The weak beam of light barely fights back the choking black fog, but it's enough to see past the soot-caked water tanks and into the mess of criss-crossed pipes up above. [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s eyes follow the electrical wire from the chandelier outside. It strings across the wall, high up, and comes down on the opposite wall, entering an electrical box near the furnace.

    "[color=#808000]Oh thank god, it IS you![/color]" he says with a sigh of relief. 

    [color=#808000]Henry [/color]wipes his brow, covered in sweat. He has a few minor injuries.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] recovers some food and water from the supply stash, and also takes some unopened packs of CIGARETTES. 

    [color=#808000]Henry[/color] explains what's been going on: 
    He says when he woke up in the room, [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] were already gone. He heard screams out in the hall, so he tried to wake [color=#808080]Nan[/color], but she was having some kind of nightmare. She tossed and turned, muttering something, and he couldn't wake her up, so he ran out to see for himself. Out in the hall, he found [color=#a00000]Anna[/color], freshly killed, and tried to approach, when the skeleton-faced creature attacked him. He ran down the stairs to escape and came here, where the others had said there was food and water, to try and take hide here and wait out the danger. It was locked, so he smashed the door open with his CHAIR LEG CLUB and took shelter. 
    He hid when he heard someone coming in, thinking it might be that skull-faced thing, and now here we are.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] turns to look at [color=#808000]Henry[/color]. [color=#808000]Henry[/color] stands frozen. 
    He swears he didn't put her in there. 
    He swears.

    Within the walls of the room, something loud and metallic rattles. There is a strange noise. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks [color=#088000]Kim[/color] how she got in there. 
    She says HE put her in there. She begs for help. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] struggles. She screams that her leg is still stuck.

    She's right here. And it seems whatever was in that furnace wasn't trying to get out. 
    It was trying to pull her in. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says it doesn't sound like an omen.

    He shakes his head and says that there's already enough suspicion going around. He was the only other person in the room, so he thought it was natural [color=#808080]Nan[/color] would suspect him. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] explains her encounter with 'herself' earlier as a point of comparison, but [color=#088000]Kim[/color] doesn't seem worried. She says omens are one thing, but as long as they're alive they have free will. She seems intent on believing it was the hotel trying to get [color=#808080]Nan[/color], and that it only looked like her as a means to an end. 

    In light of whatever just happened, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] suggests passcodes. But she's not far into explaining her idea when [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] interrupts. 
    He asks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] if she hasn't been paying attention all along. 

    Look around. 
    This place knows who we are, where we are. 

    It's watching right now. 

    You want to talk trust, he's got a better plan.

    If she wants to come back she's welcome to, but he's going to stay with [color=#088000]Kim[/color] to make sure she gets back all right. If [color=#808080]Nan[/color] wants to keep exploring, that's her business.

    Nan's arm was bitten hard enough to draw blood, and she has some rough scratches. She is badly shaken, but mostly unhurt. 

    Nan has no intention of making any kind of physical contact with him, but despite the fear and anger rushing through her, something in Santiago provokes a reaction. 
    Nan says she forgives [color=#400080]Santiago[/color]. He is hurt, confused, scared, just like anyone else here. And if there is a way to save him, she will see that he escapes this place too. 
    But she cannot forget what he has done, and warns that if he ever comes after her again, she will be ready. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] stares for a long moment.

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] gets to his feet, and Henry moves between them to defend Nan. 

    He says that what Nan has started may be too late to stop. She will have enemies at all sides. 
    Be careful shining your light around, Nan. 
    You may not always like what you find. 

    [color=#400080]Santiago[/color] says he's leaving now. Staying any longer in one place is dangerous for him. 
    He says if you want to stop him from leaving, you'll have to kill him.

    Nan does not have the journal, nor any other items with her. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] approaches [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color]. He says he didn't even notice her come in. He was focused on praying. And thinking. 

    What's the date? He's not sure anymore. He only meant to stay for a while, but it feels like [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color], who is probably around here somewhere, has been stringing him along. He knows he shouldn't question the acts of God and His teachers, but he still has yet to get that blessing. 
    In a way, it feels like he's trying to keep [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] from leaving. 

    He pauses, then looks at [color=#808080]Nan[/color] with a curious expression. 
    She's not one of the nuns here, is she?

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says he's correct, she's not a nun. 
    [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] smiles. He thought not. 

    [color=#82004a]The Padre[/color] said he needs the help of this humble pilgrim, and as he is on a holy mission of discovery, he can hardly turn down such a request. 
    He's worried about [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color]. His behavior has been... worrying. But [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] can't just abandon him. 
    He's obligated to stay until [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] releases him.

    Yes, [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] says. He knows [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] is... deeply troubled. He has become increasingly reclusive in the short time the pilgrim has been here. He seems preoccupied, and his mind - perhaps even his soul - is not at ease. He's taken a dim view of his own congregation, most especially the savage native people he came here to convert in the first place. 
    In confidence, he refers to them as vermin. 

    But that is all the more reason that he, as a servant of God, should stay to ensure things do not stray further from His plan.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] tries to convince the poor pilgrim that perhaps the local padre has lost his way. That perhaps even a respected man of the cloth might stray from the path. 
    Maybe he should leave while he can. This is not his responsibility. 

    But it is, [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] says. 
    He must do what is demanded of him by God and the church. 

    He's started building something, you know. Down in the big cellar, under the church. A furnace, maybe. He spoke of it only in passing. But he's building something. 
    He believes God has a plan. And so too must [color=#82004a]Father Velasco.[/color] 

    God works in mysterious ways. He may not understand them, but he believes in them.

    He says the figure vanished in the light. It was just... gone, all of a sudden. And then Nan was lying on the floor, mumbling to herself.

    Henry says he saw it earlier. When they were separated. There was something - someone - in the darkness. He shone a light on it and it was gone, but he saw something. A vision, or maybe a memory. He didn't see much before he awoke.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] listens for a moment, waiting. 
    From the closet, she can see that where the dark figure once stood, some writing has been etched in the wall.

    Left with little time and distracted from immediate concerns, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] steps back out of the candlelight and brandishes her LEAD PIPE.

    In an instant, they're gone. A familiar glare starts to fill the room, going white.

    You're here now. Something's going to happen today, isn't it? 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] nods. 
    Visions of fire. [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color]. Suffering.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says they need to get somewhere less open before they settle everything that's happened, and asks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] where they should go now. He's not sure if the safehouse is truly safe anymore.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] throws himself against the wall, nearly choking. Then it's true. 
    He blurts it all out, on the verge of tears. 
    They were in shifts that night. [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] and [color=#088000]Kim[/color] first. Then him and [color=#a00000]Anna[/color]. They were woken up on time. [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] and [color=#088000]Kim[/color] went to sleep. Everything was fine for a few hours. 

    Then they heard voices in the corridor. Whispering at first. It sounded like something calling. They went out to look, but couldn't find anything. They went as far as the elevator. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] wanted to go on. She said that's where the voices were coming from. But [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] didn't. He wanted to head back. He turned around to lead her, but then he heard the chime. The doors closed. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] was inside. 
    Then the lights went out. 

    He came back to the room. Tried to get help. 
    But everyone was gone. It was just you, [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. And he couldn't wake you. It was like you were in some sort of coma.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] climbs out the window and enters the TERRA COTTA COURTYARD. 
    She approaches a young nun, who is ringing the bell. 

    The nun scoffs at [color=#808080]Nan[/color] and shakes her head, asking her what she's doing out and about without being properly dressed.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says she lost track of time and asks [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] why she is ringing the bells. 

    The nun shakes her head and clicks her tongue disapprovingly. 
    [color=#808080]Sister Nancy[/color], surely you're not trying to shirk your duties again. 
    You're not out here looking for that young pilgrim are you? You're shameless. She's seen the way you watch him. 

    She ought to be careful, [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] says. 
    She is sworn to chastity and devotion to the Lord. She shouldn't be looking after that young man like she were some schoolgirl. 

    Even if he IS awfully cute.

    Of course [color=#808080]Nan[/color] knows [color=#00955d]Sister Maggie[/color]'s name. They've only been sharing quarters together for the whole year. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] shakes off the cobwebs a bit and dismisses her confusion. She tells [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] that she should know better than to suspect [color=#808080]Nan[/color] of lusty interests. She just had matters to discuss with the pilgrim. 
    [color=#008484]Mag[/color] nods with a knowing smile and elbows Nan.

    Joking aside, [color=#00955d]Sister Maggie[/color] says [color=#808080]Nan[/color] should probably get properly dressed before morning Mass. If [color=#82004a]the Father[/color] were to see her walking around in pants... 

    Nan asks where [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] is, anyway, and [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] says she last saw him in the tower over the Chapel.

    Finally, on a whim, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if the natives had a burial ground here before the Mission was built. 

    [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] recoils at first, at what she describes as a horrible thought, but then stops to ponder. She tells [color=#808080]Nan[/color] that there was no cemetery, but she does seem to recall that [color=#500000]Father Bowerman[/color], the priest before [color=#82004a]Velasco[/color], who was present for the founding of the Mission, had mentioned some kind of old foundation they had used to help construction. It was before [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s time here, of course. But if she wants to know more, [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] might have some documents on it in his study, if he'll permit it. Of course, [color=#00955d]Mag[/color] says, given how well you get on with the Natives, maybe you could just ask one of them about the history of the area.

    According to [color=#00955d]Sister Maggie[/color], [color=#500000]Father Bowerman[/color] passed peacefully in his sleep one summer night. He was old and lived a happy and full life serving the church. 

    As [color=#808080]Nan[/color] prepares to leave for her room and habit, Sister Maggie stops her. 
    Her tone is softened. 

    [color=#808080]Sister Nancy[/color], before you go, please tell me 
    You know me well enough that though I would never give in to sin and vice, I care deeply for [color=#82004a]Franc[/color]- for [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color]. I know that he is in need of us and of our support now more than ever. But my mother has taken ill and may pass, and I should like to be there for her. 
    [color=#808080]Sister Nancy[/color], she pleads for advice, 
    What should I do?

    She thanks [color=#808080]Nan[/color] quietly and nods her head. 
    She has her responsibilities to the church and to God, but she must also honor her responsibilities to her mother. She will leave and return when she is able. 

    [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] will surely understand her situation, but he will no doubt eagerly await her return. 

    Thank you, [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. Your advice has been valuable to me.

    She calmly but firmly instructs her children to come to her and step away, but her husband stands between them and stops them. 

    He says the girls shouldn't move a fucking inch. 
    And he says he's not giving them up. 
    He knows what's going on. 
    He says he knows you're all against him. That you always have been. Laughing behind his back.

    He laughs. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Well this time it's not going your way. This time he's in charge. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] says fine. 
    You caught her. 
    She laughs. 
    She laughs right at him. 
    It's no wonder he's clutching at the kids instead of coming at her directly. 
    This is about her. 
    She's the one he wants. 
    And he can't even face up to that?

    They struggle. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] fights dirty. She gets violent. She turns the pain of the abuse she's suffered back on her tormentor. 

    Her husband, unable to grab the axe back, is pushed back over to the bed. His powerful hands find [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s throat and he begins to strangle her as she attacks him.

    The door's hardly closed before [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] turns accusingly towards [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color]. He says he has a lot of explaining to do. 
    He disappeared during his shift. He didn't wake up [color=#808000]Henry[/color] and [color=#808080]Nan[/color], and his shift partner is dead.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] scoffs. He says if we can't trust our own, we'll never last. And right now there's one person in particular not being very trustworthy. He physically pins [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] against the wall with one arm. 
    You vanished during your shift. The only person you were with is dead. No one can account for you, and you say you just WANDERED OFF?

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says she's seen it. 
    The visions. 
    Flashes of other people, other places. Not dreams. More like memories. Seeing herself in someone else's shoes. 
    The things that lurk in the halls, they're the source. Light, she thinks. That's what triggers it. Going from darkness to light brings out the flashes, the visions. 
    She's seen it a number of times now. Not [b][color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color][/b], specifically, but so many people. 

    So many souls.

    At first, she thought they were trying to tell her something. Maybe a warning. Or a threat, even. Instructions of some kind. 
    But there's no rhyme or reason to them that she can see. No message. 

    A nun tending a garden in a small courtyard. 
    A young woman crying as she writes a letter to her mother in the back of a chapel. 
    Three children playing in the halls. 
    A woman making love to her husband. 
    A fistfight in a bar. 

    And she says she thinks these sights they're showing her, they're not for her sake. 
    They're for theirs. 
    Images. Memories. Sorrow, delight. Days and nights remembered. Like photos in a frame. 
    Things that go to make up a life.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] ponders for a moment, then explains that she's never actually seen one of these 'memories' from [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color]'s perspective. In fact, she's seen him before, in the memories of others, but only in shadow, or out of the corner of her eye. 
    So she's not sure that he is reliving those moments.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if she's really talking about the same person, namely the one who seems to have murdered his own congregation. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says it seems that way, yes. Evidence is certainly putting that as a possibility. But [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] was a man of faith, and we don't know the whole story. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says that to her, it looks like he's in pain. He could be as much a victim in this as the rest of us. And whatever he did -- well, maybe he had a good reason. 

    Whatever the case, [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says, her abuela used to always tell her "behind every face, there is a story". It's too early to judge.

    As unlikely as it seems, [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] assumed it was a coincidence at first. After all, [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] said he'd run into [color=#800000]Alan[/color] before he died. Surely he would've recognized him. He wouldn't still be looking for his son if he'd already found him.

He was trying to get his bearings when he heard riders approaching from outside, then there was... noise, confusion. It's like a dream, fading fast already. 

    He looks gravely to the bed, then the scorched circle.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] keeps her flashlight off, as sudden light seems to trigger visions. 
    And right now, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] figures she and the others need to stay firmly in the present. 

    The group approaches the great tower in the darkness. Its door is set with a single prominent keyhole.

    The group begins to explore the new room, investigating the furniture and the books. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] approaches the bookshelf nearer to the large stone basin, where a great fire burns. The furniture itself is strange: it begins like any other bookshelf, but the far edge is rough-hewn and primitive. One side feels like wood, but the other is rough stone. 
    And it seems much of the other furniture is similarly deformed. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] retrieves the book on the floor. 
    It appears to be a nature book, about moths. Nothing about it stands out.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] notes that the walls of the lounge feel like wood, nearer the door, but about halfway into the room, the texture becomes more like smooth stone. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] notes that this is very unsettling. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] remarks that it's very fortunate they have a lady who can fiddle with electricity to keep them safe. 

    "[color=#088000]Hey, don't scoff,[/color]" [color=#088000]Kim[/color] chides. She asks if [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s ever seen an electrical fire. There was this one nightclub near where she used to live. It burnt down when she was a kid, from bad wiring or something. A bunch of people died. Rumor around school was one of the bodies was melted to the fire extinguisher. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] recommends they drop the grisly subject, at least until they can leave the room.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] asks -- out there? Really there? Or from in here? 
    Somehow, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] isn't sure anymore. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] approaches the fire as well, looking over books and papers. 
    She says some of these books are hundreds of years old. 
    There's even a newspaper from 1910.

    Suspecting that this is the letter she witnessed [color=#800000]Alan[/color] writing only minutes before, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] cautiously checks [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]. 
    He seems preoccupied with a nearby bookcase.

    With great hesitation, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] slowly unfolds the old, burnt newspaper page lying beneath the clipping. 
    It's dated December, 1828.

    In the darkness, a gunshot rings out. Rock shatters somewhere in the room as the errant shot ricochets. 
    There is much screaming and commotion. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] calls out [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color]'s name, but the blade comes down. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] draws up her flashlight. The motion inadvertently blocks the plunging knife, but her hand is badly gouged, and the flashlight is knocked away somewhere into the dark room.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is overwhelmed, and now half-dazed. She struggles to focus. 
    The monstrous figure rears back for another strike, and [color=#808080]Nan[/color] kicks with both legs. It doesn't seem to do any damage, but it knocks the figure off balance for just a moment, giving her a chance to escape.

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] has grabbed the horrible figure from behind, and struggles to keep it restrained, but it does not seem this effort will hold long. 
    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] appears to be badly wounded, and Nan can see him clutching at his chest and arm. 

    The figure thrashes and waves its knife. 
    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] calls out "[color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color]". She demands she is not Anasazi.

    Her hand is wet with blood. 

    There's a noise from behind -- [color=#088000]Kim[/color] screaming from the doorway. In the fray, it's hard to make out, but it sounds like she's yelling "hurry". 

    The figure thrashes angrily, reaching out for [color=#808080]Nan[/color]. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] won't be able to hold him for much longer. 

    There's no time to find the flashlight. [color=#808080]Nan[/color] has only moments to make her choice.

    [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color] frantically rushes up to Nan, clamping the thick fabric of the robe over her mouth, to avoid another bite. But [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s already made herself known. 

    "[color=#b0b000]This-- it's not a good time.[/color]" Henry responds. "[color=#b0b000]I'm busy right now. Come back later.[/color]"

    Nan[/color] attempts to stomp [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color]'s foot, but it seems he's learned his lesson and easily moves out of the way. He shoots [color=#808080]Nan[/color] an angry glare.

    [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color] opens the door.

    She knows it's a shock. She can't believe that thing was [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color] all along, but it explains a few things. He distracted her up in the lounge, then knocked her down and took her taser. So keep an eye out for him, because he's probably got that now.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] kneels down in the shallow water, but there's no response at the small hole in the door. The rat appears to have gone. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] suggests she and [color=#088000]Kim[/color] look for [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color]. 
    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] agrees it's a good idea. Plus, [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s gun might be able to shoot off the bracings on the chain. But where should they start? With how this place is, [color=#088000]Kim[/color]'s not even sure the stairs to the fourth floor are still going to be there.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] feels the door. It's warm to the touch, but there's a hole in the corner, so air can pass through freely. 

    There are strange noises coming from the other side, faintly. Scraping metal, some kind of movement. But when [color=#808080]Nan[/color] calls out at the door, there's no response.

    They climb the stairs all the way to the THIRD FLOOR LANDING. 
    The stairway to the fourth floor is gone. 

    But [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] are here.

    The group exchanges relieved greetings, but [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s condition puts a damper on any joy the reunion might bring. 

    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] explains that [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] caught his own ricochet back in the lounge when he was aiming for [b][color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color][/b]. It went through his arm and hit one of his lungs. Maybe more. [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] doesn't know what to do for him and he's losing a lot of blood. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] reveals that [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color] was [b][color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color][/b], which [color=#088000]Kim[/color] corroborates. She shows them the HORSE SKULL. She reveals his fate at [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s own hands. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] looks both shaken and relieved, but [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] just coughs, wetly, shaking his head. 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] said he never did like that bastard. 
    But he didn't see it coming. He was right under their noses. He should have seen it.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] shakes his head. 
    He says he's past the point of saving. Lost too much blood. 

    Still, can't end like this. 
    Had to find his son. Had to save him. 

    Can't go like this. Wanted to die fighting.

    Never found him. He just figured he'd gone into the desert to die. 
    Until the day something drew him here.

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] rises to his feet with great difficulty, resting against the wall. 
    He says take it. They can hope that the evil in it came from him. 

    As for last wishes,

    Between [color=#808080]Nan[/color], [color=#088000]Kim[/color], and [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color], they now have two weapons: [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color]'s TWISTED KNIFE and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s REVOLVER. [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] says it's her call how they get divided. 

    [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] rests his back against the wall and wishes [color=#808080]Nan[/color] good luck. He says the stairs are a little much for him right now.

    Forgiveness. 

    She's been trying to piece it together this whole time. But now, seeing [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] like that, she knows what has to be done. 

    Everyone here has sinned. That much is clear. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] was right about that. 
    Think about everything they've seen so far. [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color]'s dark secrets. [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color]'s dark past with his son. Visions. Confessions. Absolution. Cleansing fire. 

    She needs to repent. She needs to confess to [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] and beg his forgiveness before God.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] continues to inspect the chain on the door while [color=#088000]Kim[/color] talks. It looks like there's a spot where the chains are anchored to the door's frame. 
    The chains themselves are thick and strong, but the brace is fastened in the wood itself. It's possible a bullet would destroy it, and the chain could be pulled back through the hole. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] suggests that [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] has done no real harm to them. 
    Think about it: everyone they know who was harmed was harmed by [color=#b0b000]Henry[/color], as [b][color=#b0b000]the Pilgrim[/color][/b]. Not [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color]. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] and [color=#800000]Alan[/color] were both killed by Henry. [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] was injured trying to shoot him. 
    But [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] hasn't killed anyone. 

    He is angry. She will make her confession before him, and leave her fate in god's hands.

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says that's only further proof, then: he knew this would be coming. She is meant to confess. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is firm in her concern. She questions whether real forgiveness can come from an outside source. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] says if she doesn't believe, she had better hurry with that door. 

    [color=#82004a]The Padre[/color] is on his way. She can feel it. 
    She prayed for him.

    Well, not on flesh. 

    [color=#088000]Kim[/color] still has one eye that appears to be working, at the least.

    The circular walls of the immense clay chamber are covered in hundreds of rough silhouettes, black-flecked and ashen, like the ones [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s seen before. 

    At the far end, a blacked stone altar stands before strange painted shapes and figures in the same textured style as the silhouettes.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] examines the altar itself. 

    A large, ragged, dark-stained cloth is draped over the strangely-shaped black stone altar. 
    The altar bears odd markings, and a conspicuous hole in the side.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] removes the cloth that was wedged into a seam in the stone. It doesn't seem to have been hiding anything. 

    The larger hole in the side is dark. Too dark to see anything through. 
    But judging from the markings, the hole above it is a match for Nan's CROSS KEY.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] inserts the CROSS KEY into the stone slot. It sinks in with a click. 

    With a grinding noise, the entire front half of the stone altar falls away.

    [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] shakes his head. He says he's sorry, but he doesn't know anything about that. The glimpses he gets outside this room are rare. 
    Most of the events of the last years have gone by without his notice. 

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] explains that she saw the man who called himself [color=#82004a]Lightbringer[/color]. That he told of some event to come, which would require her to kill him. She says he called her [color=#808080]Stranger[/color], in some lighthouse by the sea. 

    She says she knows [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] killed 466 when he burnt the mission to the ground with his congregation inside, thinking it would absolve him.

    No. 

    With great effort, [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] sits up. 
    He says it was not murder. 
    It was a sacrifice. 

    [color=#82004a]The Father[/color] did not start the fire for selfish reasons. He did not do it for his own soul. 
    He did it for all of us.

    He says [color=#808080]Nan[/color] is correct. 
    On that day, [color=#82004a]the Father[/color] called in his entire congregation, even from nearby towns. 

    And he burnt them alive. 

    But when the doors closed, they knew what was going to happen. 
    Because he told them.

    "[color=#008484]That's why they welcomed it. They knew what it meant.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks what it is. 

    For a long moment, [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] just tries to breathe. Roughly, unevenly. 

    He asks if [color=#808080]Nan[/color] knows of the Anasazi. 

    They were an ancient people who lived not far from here. They were brilliant for their time. Their cities of stone were incredible, far advanced. They had many churches. 
    And then something happened. 

    Almost overnight, the Anasazi were decimated, and scholars can't say by what. They did not vanish, but their decline was rapid. 
    Those that survived moved on. They re-settled further away. Many savages may once have been Anasazi. Even the natives of [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color]'s congregation, who called themselves Hopi. 

    They must have had a name for it.

    It came from beyond the sea. 
    And with it came many heralds. 

    [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] says he didn't know it, but by the time he reached the mission, [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] already felt it. He was the first. 
    He searched desperately for answers.

    And so [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] sought guidance from the very people he had once called "vermin". 

    He sought out the Hopi wise men, the savage shamans, and the natives of his congregation, who might know more. 
    They came to this place. They told him the stories. 

    And he knew that this had happened before.

    So you see, [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] is a good man. 

    Flawed, perhaps, as we all are. 
    But good. 

    It took great conviction to perform the ritual.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] indicates [color=#088000]Kim[/color] and the injury she sustained. She says that [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] does not appear to still be the good man he once knew. 

    [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] shakes his head. 

    "[color=#008484]That thing out there is not Francis Velasco.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] asks if it can be killed. 

    [color=#008484]Lorenzo[/color] says he hopes so. It's their only chance now, at stopping this. 

    That was the soul of the sacrifice. 
    The ritual required one man to commit the others to the fire. The one to perform the sacrifice. This was the role [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] was to play. 
    They called this man [color=#82004a]the Lightbringer[/color].

    He sighs, gesturing weakly to the wall. 
    He says they called him the Stranger. 

    The ritual needed someone who was not Anasazi. 
    An outsider. Who came from far away. Not a part of the group to be sacrificed. No ties to the people there. 

    That was me.

    That day, [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color] told them what had to be done. 

    Most people would turn on him, accuse blasphemy against God, even call for hanging, with his sympathies for the savage pagan religion. 
    But he spoke with conviction, and he saw their faces. They had all felt it. They knew it was coming. 
    They knew he was right.

    But they suffered. 

    And he watched.

    It wasn't over. The souls gave power to the flames, and the thing was drawn to them. 
    And to [color=#82004a]Father Velasco[/color]. 
    Some fragment of it would be drawn into him. 

    So [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] was prepared upon his altar, and as ash filled the chapel, they waited for the first sign of its presence.

    He waited for a sign, to take this man's life.

    But I failed, and it bloomed in the darkness. 

    I knew I was too late. It had already seized him when I struck. Again and again I let the hammer fall, but it would not be killed. 

    I had little time until it broke free of the chains. So I acted quickly, and bound some piece of its power within myself. 
    And then I fled here, to seal myself away.

    It reaches out, beyond its cage, grabbing at poor souls that pass in the world beyond. And it grows stronger. Soon it will no longer need me. It will be strong enough to escape and visit this horror on all mankind.

    "[color=#008484]I am no longer the outsider. I have become a part of this. And my chance to escape this nightmare alive died many years ago. 
    Once Velasco is dead, the fragment of this thing that I've kept trapped within me will be all that is left. Destroy me and you destroy its last tether.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] has an idea. Even if [color=#82004a]the Padre[/color] is mortal as he is, he's also clearly powerful, and getting stronger.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] has seen visions of people and places long out of time with herself. She may even have influenced these things in a way that changed their course. 
    [color=#2020f0]Pablo[/color] confirms this. He saw it once, in the saferoom.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] can feel the bones in her arm snap as white-hot pain jolts through her.

    Without turning her back on the figure, [color=#808080]Nan[/color] presses the pendant against the wall behind her, tracing a familiar symbol.

    "[color=#400080]I don't know what happened - I found a way through the old room to get here. Don't open the door, the courtyard--[/color]" 

    A deafening peal shakes the entire room, like the sound of thunder, or the ringing of some enormous bell. 

    Shadows burst writhing from the doorway.

    [color=#808080]Nan[/color] rushes to the door. In the darkness beyond, vague shapes move slowly. Faint murmuring pierces the booming noise of the Chapel. There's no mistaking it. 
    [color=#000]The Beast[/color] is out there. 

    The door is locked on this side. 
    The bolt is wrapped with what appears to be human hair.

    In light of the apparent fact that interactive adventures are acceptable [on /tg/], I've decided to continue Ruby here. For those who already saw the first part back when I had to post it on /r9k/, hopefully you'll just bear with me on this one and not provide any undue spoilers until we're past the end of the last one. A flood of /b/█████ migrating from their dying board sort of put a damper on that attempt.

    So, get out your parser interface and let's see what we can do here.

    Sadly, Ruby has no vampiric powers.

    Ruby gets the feeling that pressing all the buttons would probably be a bad idea. There are buttons of multiple colors -- which one should she try?

    Ruby surveys her surroundings. There are no doors here, except for a portal on the north wall of this room. Unfortunately, there are metal shutters over the door.

    Ruby tries her best, but the lid of the barrel refuses to be pulled from its base. It won't open.

  "c": "Ruby: Look for a way to open the other cell."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/16.gif[/img]

    The cell/locker/coffin on the ground has a latch on the outside, but it's sealed with what appears to be a digital lock. There's no obvious way to undo the lock from the locker itself.

    The barrel's lid comes up with the can-opener's tenacious efforts!
    Inside there's a few small lengths of BARE ELECTRICAL WIRE, but nothing else.
  "n":

  "i": 17

  "c": "Ruby: Get some wire."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/18.gif[/img]

    Ruby stows a piece of wire in her inventory.

    Ruby has no magical or otherwise extraordinary powers. She has no knowledge of where she is or how she got here, and though she is not a specialist and holds no particularly special knowledge she is reasonably competent with things most people would be.
    Her physical capabilities are varied. She's limber, in good shape, but not particularly strong.
    She is currently carrying:
    CAN-OPENER
    BARE LENGTH OF WIRE
  "n":

  "i": 18

  "c": "Ruby: Chew on wire."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/18.gif[/img]

    Ruby is above such primitive practices as chewing on wire and cannibalizing her young. If she had any.
    And besides, that would not be productive right now!
  "n":
  - 20
  "i": 19
- "d": 1477690157000
  "c": "Ruby: Shlick furiously."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/20.gif[/img]

    Ruby has slightly bigger concerns at the moment. Slightly. 
    But besides, there could be hidden cameras around!
  "n":
  - 21
  "i": 20
- "d": 1477690196000
  "c": "Ruby: Check the terminal next to the door."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/20.gif[/img]

    It would appear these controls are out of order. But even Ruby can tell this looks like an easy fix. Firstly, one of the wires is missing. Splicing it back together would be easy enough with the BARE LENGTH OF WIRE Ruby found. Then, there are connectors at the back of the control panel itself, so it will need to be screwed back into place.
  "n":

  "i": 21

  "c": "Ruby: Knock on the other cell."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/22.gif[/img]

    Ruby knocks insistently on the metal locker cell, but there's no audible or visible response.
  "n":

  "i": 22
- "d": 1477690331000
  "c": "Ruby: Check the trap on the back left corner."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/23.gif[/img]

    There's some kind of access shaft in the corner of the room, complete with a ladder set into the wall, but it's barred off and Ruby can't fit through!
  "n":
  - 24
  "i": 23
- "d": 1477690397000
  "c": "Ruby: Move the remains of the barrel to one side, see if anything lies under
    it."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/24.gif[/img]

    Ruby tries to shove the big barrel aside, but her physique is just too admirably girlish. It won't budge.
  "n":
  - 25
  "i": 24
- "d": 1477690441000
  "c": "Ruby: Create a saw using the barrel pieces, wrapping the handle with the BARE
    ELECTRICAL WIRE. Attempt to saw through the bars."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/25.gif[/img]

    Not only would a saw made of razor-sharp barrel-metal and bare wire be INCREDIBLY dangerous to use in ANY way, it certainly wouldn't have the durability or control to cut through these bars, which appear to be a stronger metal than the barrel anyway.

    You do get +1 INGENUITY for your idea though.
  "n":

  "i": 25

  "c": "Ruby: Check the terminal situated on the wall behind the barrel."

    The digital console appears to be waiting for a command.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Enter command."
  "b": |-

    That seemed to do something. A soft click comes from the other locker.
  "n":

  "i": 27

  "c": "Ruby: Enter \"sound horn\"."
  "b": |-

    The console doesn't appear to recognize that command.
  "n":

  "i": 28
- "d": 1477690608000
  "c": "Ruby: Enter \"open door\"."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/29.gif[/img]

    That got a response, but unfortunately the results weren't what Ruby had hoped for.

  "c": "Ruby: Open the locker."
  "b": |-

    Ruby takes the two small coins off the top of the locker and pockets them. She opens it up to find...

    There's no one inside the locker.
    Instead, all that's inside is a pair of rubber gloves.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Enter \"open access shaft\"."

  "c": "Ruby: Don the gloves, fix the terminal with the wire, and screw it together
    using one of the coins."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/32.gif[/img]

    A brilliant idea, especially since it negates the possibility of electrocution.
    Ruby sets to work splicing the door panel's wires back together.
  "n":
  - 33
  "i": 32
- "d": 1477690896000
  "c": "Ruby: Inspect the coins."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/33.gif[/img]

    The two coins seem to just be ordinary-looking quarters.
    But the edges make functional screwdrivers for the flathead screws in the panel!

    Ruby screws the repaired panel back in place, and the UP ARROW button lights up green.
  "n":
  - 34
  "i": 33

  "c": "Ruby: Press the green button."

    Using the number on the plaque outside as a reference, Ruby attempts to try opening the bars to the access shaft via the computer terminal once more.

    The water is murky. Ruby can see neither the surface nor any details on the sea life swimming past the glass.

    After entering the code, the bars on the grate finally slide open with a loud "clank"! The access shaft is accessible!
  "n":

    Tom won't say how long he's been here. Just that he woke up in the cell and hasn't gotten out since.

    It appears to be another sort of access hatch, this time with metal shutters over it. It's labelled "Z-HATCH" and just underneath where that's written there's an empty space with four holes. It looks like something used to go there.

  "c": "Ruby: Use can opener to cut through fence."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/51.gif[/img]

    The grate is thin, but given that it's a cell the metal is clearly very strong and unlike the barrel, it's not worn. The CAN-OPENER would have no chance against it.

    The fishtank is bolted to the pedestal it's on, which in turn is bolted to the floor.
    But the little treasure chest is coming with Ruby. It gets added to her inventory, a little wet. It's about the size of her hand.

    Firstly, Tom refuses to hand over the plate with the funny numbers on it, because it's a part of his Opus. Secondly, he couldn't pass it through the small openings in the grate even if he wanted to give it to Ruby.
    And thirdly, Tom tells Ruby that when he pressed the middle button, he was ELECTROCUTED. He hasn't pressed any of the others and he will refuse to press any of the others until he's confident they won't result in another near-death experience.

    Lastly, he has no clue what the overhead hatch does. He's never seen it open.

    It's a small portal in the north wall. Ruby might be able to fit through if she crawled. But it's a moot point since it's blocked by a metal shutter.

    Tom says he doesn't trust you now and he won't tell you the magic numbers on the plate.

    That seems a little extreme! Ruby's not very eager to just give up her body for some stranger to ravage just so she can get a few numbers, especially if there's an alternative. And anyway, she's shy. 

    There must be a way to win over the cat that's not quite so embarrassing.

    Climbing back down, Ruby finds that the z-hatch is now open. Just on the other side of the wall is a small room.

    Ruby tells Tom she'll be right back. Tom nods absently in reply.

    Ruby gets on all fours and crawls through the hatch with a rather suggestive series of movements. But since that's boring let's just skip ahead to the part where she emerges in the room on the other side of the wall.

    You bring the diagram to Tom. He is already starting to trust you, and with the added incentive that only one "electrocution" symbol is present on the diagram, you manage to convince him the other buttons will not administer shocks.

    Tom hesitates, standing close to the grate... then presses button 1, not for a moment considering the diagram could have been coded based on the key sequence listed on the wall panel by the fishtank.

    Luckily that doesn't seem to be the case anyway!
    ...but nothing appears to happen. Except that the button sinks into the wall just like the electro-button did, and for a moment, there seems to be a faint, distant "beep"...

    Ruby presses the DOWN ARROW button, and in the far corner of the room, another hatch opens up.
    Looking down, Ruby sees that the shaft leads straight into Tom's cell. 
    But there's no ladder.
  "n":

    Ruby is far too shy to do something like that with a stranger, especially in this situation, especially with the fact there could be hidden cameras watching. It's not the kind of thing she'd want to have someone get on tape.

    Ruby politely asks Tom to move the couch. With his MANLY PHYSIQUE, the task is no problem, and the wide couch slides away from the wall, revealing a small access hatch even smaller than the Z-Hatch used to enter this room. It appears to open into a lit room on the other side.

    Ruby kneels down to see that the room beyond has bare metal walls and exposed pipes and circuitry, and is probably some sort of maintenance area. There don't appear to be any immediate dangers like people, fire, or big, obvious traps.
    Due to the size of the hatch, however, only Ruby, with her GIRLISH FIGURE would be able to squeeze through. Tom would have to stay behind somewhere.

    There's a device containing purple liquid, with a sort of pluglike hole set it in, and beneath that, drips of purple. There's no visible faucet to remove the liquid.
    There's what appears to be a pneumatic tube running through the ceiling with a small compartment here.
    There's a metal transfer compartment in the wall, like a bank deposit drawer.

    The gloves are too thick and sturdy to just tie off with the thin string. They certainly wouldn't keep the liquid in.

    As soon as the chute's door closes, the sound of loud pneumatic pressure comes from the tube. The hand quickly and messily travels up the tube and out of sight.

    Ruby fumbles with the condom, rather unfamiliar with these things, and finally tears it open a bit harder than she intended to.

    Thanks for bearing with me, folks. It's been a fun TEN STRAIGHT HOURS I've been doing this (+2 hours prep beforehand for room design/drawing).
    I'm sure you've already noticed I'm not particularly artistic, nor a particularly quick-draw. Today's portion of the adventure was fun, I learned some things about my limits (e.g. avoid action scenes like the monster fight, that took up a whole goddamn thread, even though most of it was the 40+ responses per image), and we made some progress.
    I've been trying to give people more freedom with their actions since a lot of people were accusing me of railroading early on, so I hope that was a bit more fun as well.

    Don't worry, Ruby's story isn't over yet. There's still more to come, soon enough.
    Thanks for your support, /tg/.

    Ruby wakes up.

    Ruby appears to be in a bed.
    She feels mostly unhurt, but disoriented. She appears to be in one piece.
  "n":

    Ruby is wearing pajamas.
    She is not carrying any items.

    Morning sunlight streams in through the window. It's too bright to see much with her eyes adjusted to the darkness.

    Ruby can't remember a coffin.

    Ruby knows something:
    This is her bedroom.

    There's a COPPER KEY inside.
    Ruby pockets the COPPER KEY.

    Ruby says hi to Tom. She wonders why Tom is in her bedroom.
    Tom does not respond.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Check the door."
  "b": |-

    The odd door is set into the wall, flush with its edges. It is also locked.

    Some of Ruby's items are missing.
    She is also holding a COPPER KEY.

  "c": "Ruby: Inspect circular thing on wall."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/264.gif[/img]

    There's a strange circular thing on the wall opposite the broken window/mirror, which looks almost like a clock. There are no hands, but there is a circular peg in the center.
    There are no numbers, only four odd symbols.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: See if the door is unlocked."

  "c": "Ruby: Figure out if climbing through the window is a safe method of leaving."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/264.gif[/img]

    The window is still too small for Ruby to fit through, and even if she could, it's lined with sharp broken plate glass.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Check wastebin next to dummy."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/264.gif[/img]

    It looks almost like a filing cabinet. There's only one drawer, but it won't open. It seems jammed, rather than locked, since there's no keyhole.
  "n":
  - 269
  "i": 268

  "c": "Ruby: Check sink."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/269.gif[/img]

    There's a small depression on the surface, just beside the sink's basin. Otherwise, the sink is unremarkable, if a bit bare.
  "n":

  "i": 269

  "c": "Ruby: Fiddle with the knobs on the sink."

    Ruby turns the knobs, but no water comes out. Maybe it's broken.

    A large tarpaulin is stretched tightly over the wall above the window.

  "c": "Ruby: Open DO NOT OPEN box."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/272.gif[/img]

    The crate is closed tightly. Ruby will never be able to open it with her bare hands.

  "c": "Ruby: Look under, or remove banner."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/275.gif[/img]

    The blue tarpaulin is firmly nailed to the wall, too tightly to just pull down even if Ruby COULD reach it at a comfortable angle. It's also too tight to peek under.
  "n":

  "i": 275

  "c": "Ruby: Inspect black window, and the little diagram next to it."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/275.gif[/img]

    It's some sort of digital screen, but it's blank.
    Immediately underneath it is what appears to be a high-tech palm scanner.
  "n":
  - 277
  "i": 276

  "c": "Ruby: Use copper key on copper lock."
  "b": |-

    The door unlocks and the key becomes predictably stuck.

    The door can be opened now.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Put your hand on the palm scanner."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/278.gif[/img]

    Ruby's palm doesn't work. The machine beeps once with a very incorrect-sounding beep, and a tiny red light blinks a few times.
  "n":
  - 279
  "i": 278

  "c": "Ruby: Take a piece of glass and cut up the dummy."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/278.gif[/img]

    Ouch!
    The glass is too dangerously sharp to use as a tool, and the dummy's exterior is thick and padded. Ruby's skin gives way before the dummy's and she accidentally cuts her palm with the glass.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Try to remove the nails from the tarp."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/280.gif[/img]

    The nails aren't in all the way, so they can't be pried with the coins, but despite her strongest efforts, they still refuse to be pulled out of the wall with Ruby's bare hands.
  "n":
  - 281

  "c": "Ruby: Is that a hangman's noose around the dummy's neck?"
  "b": |-

  "c": "Ruby: Look outside the broken window."

    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/283.gif[/img]

    It's the maintenance room that Ruby was trapped in, fought something in, and was nearly poisoned with a flood of gas in. It looks the same as before.
  "n":

    ...this place looks familiar.

    The door seems to have been set into the wall in such a way as to appear hidden when closed.
  "n":

    Ruby is back in the room with the lockers.

  "c": "Ruby: Inspect the buttons on your locker."

    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/288.gif[/img]

    The buttons are all unlit and gray now. Pressing them yields no result.
    However, there's a familiar-looking vial inside the locker labeled "Succimer".
    Ruby pockets the ARSENIC ANTIDOTE.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Check other locker."

    Ruby finds her BALL OF STRING, and pockets it.

  "c": "Ruby: Back down the laddder."

  "c": "Ruby: Use the key and string to make a lasso."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/291.gif[/img]

    Ruby doesn't have the key, it got stuck in the lock.
    It showed up in her inventory because SOMEONE was too careless to delete it from the display after it got used up.

    She certainly can't reach it like this, even standing on the heavy barrel.
  "n":

    Ruby enters the back room through the Z-Hatch.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Say hello."
  "b": |-

    Ruby cautiously says hello and introduces herself.
    The man greets Ruby and introduces himself as "Red".

  "c": "Ruby: Ask Red some things."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/294.gif[/img]

    Ruby asks Red a number of questions. He responds very calmly and briefly to each one.
    He doesn't know how he got here.
    He doesn't know how long he's been here.
    He doesn't know what this place is.
    He hasn't seen anyone by Tom's description.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Ask him if he'd like to escape with her."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/295.gif[/img]

    Red shakes his head.
    Red tells Ruby there's nothing to escape from.
    He's not trapped anywhere.

    Red is very uninterested in all of Ruby's questions.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Ask him for help pulling the lever."

    Red obligingly follows Ruby to the other room, and offers to pull the lever himself.
    He stands on his toes on the barrel and uses his cane to latch the lever.
  "n":

  "c": "==>"
  "b": |-

    Red smiles, his action successful.
    The lever again snaps back into the ceiling and a loud shifting sound comes from upstairs.
  "n":

  "i": 298
- "d": 1494597218000
  "c": "Ruby: Ask Red..."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/299.gif[/img]

    Red says he is getting very tired of Ruby's questions.
    Red tells Ruby that if she doesn't stop asking questions he might have to bite her throat out.
  "n":

  "c": "==>"
  "b": |-

    Red smiles at Ruby's reaction.
    He says he is
    just kidding.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Give Red some fish."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/298.gif[/img]

    There are no more fish, Ruby used the last ones to test the sample. All that remains is the painted fish on the back wall of the aquarium tank.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Ask Red..."
  "b": |-

    Ruby decides maybe it's best not to ask Red anything more right now.
  "n":

  "i": 302

  "c": "Ruby: Thank Red, and go upstairs."

  "c": "Ruby: Enter computer room."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/304.gif[/img]

    Ruby enters the other room. 
    The screens have changed. Perhaps restoring power brought this system back online.
    The eye-marked disc is on the floor where Ruby knocked it after opening the chest earlier.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Pick up monocol, examine screens closer."
  "b": |-

    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/306.gif[/img]

    Ruby pockets the wooden disc with the eye on it and the triangle on one end.
    Several small, difficult to see images appear on the secondary monitors.
    Ruby presses Y.

    A larger, clearer image appears on the main monitor.
  "n":

    The thick paper of the diagram curves around the pipe and suddenly gets stuck over the hole as the suction is restored. The hole is sealed with the makeshift patch, but it might not last very long.
    Ruby ties it in place with string just to be safe.

    There's a utilitarian metal hamper here. Something is inside. Ruby decides to get it. One moment.
    There's a pit in the center of the room, spattered with dried blood. Sitting in the center is a scrap of paper. Ruby will pick that up in just a second, too.

    The hatch in the southeast corner has a ladder, and looking down, it appears to lead into the cell room below. Something about that fact seems odd.

    The corner has some sort of strange, smooth organic growth latched onto two walls and the floor. 
    It looks almost like skin.

    Ruby finds a FOOTY SOCK PAJAMA FOOT in the hamper, evidently torn from a full set of pajama bottoms and tied off at about the ankle. It's slightly heavy.

    Tom explains that he lost his eye while he was being dragged off to the room he spent the last few days in. The thing that brought him there did it.
    Ruby must just not have noticed, between her flashes and distractions.

    Unfortunately, Tom says he didn't get a good look at whatever dragged him away. He was already sick.
    He says most of the pain of his eye has gone away by now.

    Tom looks like he feels better.

    Ruby tells Tom what's happened. Tom explains he's been weak and despondent lately, and unfortunately can't help her with many details, except that the western door in the room with the big console (the one that the fishtank-door leads to) is the way into the room he was trapped in.

    They both agree that the only thing to do now is go forward.

    Tom and Ruby both go back down the access hatch to check the z-hatch. 

    Also, there is a hook on the ground here -- but it is not sharp, and it is riveted firmly to the ground. It's essentially just a heavy-duty eyehook.

    Ruby and Tom emerge in the back room.

    In the small closet to the east, on a shelf, there is a large metal safe. Instead of a combination lock, it has a spherical indentation about as big as Ruby's fist, like a socket.

    The room is also quite clean.

    The shelves are bare. The lightbulb is on, looking unremarkable and harsh. The lock is simply a spherical indentation -- there's nothing more significant about the socket to speak of. That's all there is to it.

    Ruby can't open the MEDICINE BAG.
    There's a TINY PADLOCK of surprising strength keeping it closed.

    Ruby heads WEST (remember, the view was reversed on entering the back room) and -- now that the hatch is much larger -- she is able to take Tom with her into the side room behind the couch.

    The window between the rooms is now sealed with a heavy plastic, perhaps to avoid breaking.

    The electrical panel has been covered up by a protective plate and marked with the symbol for electricity.

    There is an electrical outlet visible here.

    The person behind the door tosses a small, thin metal rod onto the floor.

    Ruby pulls the lever up...
    ...only to find it has far more slack than she realized!

    Something in the room moves in response to the pulling of the lever, but Ruby can't really see it from here.

    Ruby attempts to press the second button from the top...

    Fuck yeah!
    Tom goes to work smashing up the shelves for no good reason, and carefully avoids breaking the lightbulb.

    Then he decides what the heck and smashes the lightbulb anyway. It's very satisfying.

    Ruby and Tom enter the room Tom was trapped in earlier.
    The walls are covered with graffiti. There are numerous items here, including a SHOVEL HEAD, EMPTY RED SPRAYCAN, Red's CANE, and the remnants of another implement broken to create one of the two stakes. There is a METAL BOX here.
    The pneumatic tube here is empty.
    There are doors to the north and to the south.

    RED is here.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Examine room. Tom: Open metal box."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/505.gif[/img]

    Red's face is grotesquely deformed, with an impossibly huge grin.
    Red is impaled through the back of his neck and through the right side of his skull by large stakes. Red is covered in blood and not moving. 
    Red's dead, baby.

    Ruby doesn't particularly want to disturb Red's body, let alone pull out thick wooden stakes jammed through his gray matter.

    TOM examines the METAL BOX Red left. It appears unlocked, so he opens it.
  "n":

  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/506.gif[/img]

    The screen is just static. 
    Ruby examines the items. There is a METAL TOOL HEAD that looks like it broke off one of the two stakes, but it does not appear useful in its current broken state.

  "c": "Tom: The box. Open it."

    Tom opens the BOX. There is a NOTE.
    Tom also notices a COIN in the pile of stuff under the note.

    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/508.gif[/img]

    Ruby takes the CANE and SHOVEL HEAD, but leaves the EMPTY SPRAYCAN and the METAL TOOL HEAD, as both appear unhelpful in their current state.

    The door to the north opens.
    A very large figure appears in the doorway.

    Ruby gets the very distinct impression that this individual is not friendly.
  "n":

  "i": 509

    Tom discards the NOTE as he finishes reading.
    There is something under the NOTE.

  "b": |-

    Suddenly, a flash of memory returns to Ruby.

    The figure does not seem friendly.
    She remembers the figure...

    The figure is the one who put her in the locker.
  "n":

  "c": "Tom: Run out of the room at HIGH SPEED."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/512.gif[/img]

    Ruby doesn't see the BOMB.
    Tom reacts quickly and runs from the room. He grabs Ruby and quickly carries her along.

    Tom leaps from the room just as a huge, poorly-rendered explosion erupts from behind them.

    The explosion blasts through the air above them, filling the room with heat.

    Ruby and Tom appear unharmed. The building around them still shudders from the explosion, but it appears the imminent danger is gone.
    The room to the north appears to have been filled with debris. It is now inaccessible.
    [CUTSCENE OVER]
  "n":

  "c": "Tom: Consider the strength of the bomb."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/518.gif[/img]

    The explosion seems quite localized -- the door to the north is inaccessible, and most likely, the room the explosion took place in is all but obliterated, but it seems most of the other rooms are unaffected. The area as a whole does not seem to have had a particularly strong reaction.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Thank Tom."
  "b": |-

    Ruby thanks Tom for saving her life again.
    Tom blushes slightly. He says it's what anyone would have done in that situation.

    It would appear Red used the TWO COINS as some kind of makeshift contacts for his homemade bomb.

  "c": "Ruby: Look at the tiny light outline."

    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/522.gif[/img]

    There seems to be a doorway hidden in the wall. A light comes through a crack from the other side. Perhaps the door was jarred loose in the explosion.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Weapons out, and listen."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/522.gif[/img]

    The air is deathly silent after the near-deafening explosion.
    Ruby and Tom draw their SCALPEL and CROWBAR, respectively.
  "n":

  "i": 523

    more yourself."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/524.gif[/img]

    Ruby is drawing a blank, beyond the image of being put into the metal cell by the figure.
    Tom says he recognizes them. It is the same figure that dragged him away to that room when he was suffering from arsenic poisoning.
  "n":

    A preliminary examination of the room below suggests there has been no extraneous damage, but the lights seem to be off in most of the rooms.

  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Go to dummy room."

    There doesn't appear to be any damage here either.

  "c": "Tom: Examine dummy's glowing eyes."

    Tom examines the glowing eyes on the dummy. He can't tell what's causing the light.

    Ruby gets scared and backs away from the dummy.
  "n":

  "i": 527

  "c": "Ruby: Get a grip and stay the FUCK away from that box."
  "b": |-

    Ruby can't resist... she looks in the box.

    The box is empty.
  "n":

  "c": "Tom: Poke dummy in the eye."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/528.gif[/img]

    Tom uses the sharp end of the crowbar instead, and jabs one of the eyes.
    It makes a squishy sound.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Get out."
  "b": |-

    Tom and Ruby decide to quickly vacate the room.
    They head back upstairs.

    Ruby and Tom check the room for obvious dangers, take a moment to let their eyes adjust, and then enter...

    There is a door to the west. The door to the north seems to lead to the room where Red's body was just found. It is inaccessible due to debris.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Examine room."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/534.gif[/img]

    Tom and Ruby inspect the room.
    There is a bottle of CHAMPAGNE on the table. Tom takes it.
    There is a NOTE on the other table. Ruby will inspect that in just a moment.
    On the north wall is the doorway to the room the bomb went off in. The heavy door has been blown to pieces but seemed to protect this room rather well from the blast. The doorway is marked "Holding" by a sign above it.

    There is a WATER COOLER here.
    Beside the cooler, there is a set of METAL SHUTTERS, which are wrapped shut at the base with barbed wire.
  "n":

  "i": 534

  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Drink some water."

    Strangely, neither Tom nor Ruby is very thirsty.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Examine hole below the vent."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/536.gif[/img]

    There appears to be something in the back of the hole, but it's wedged in there good! Ruby can't get it out with her bare hands, she'd need some kind of precise implement to grab it.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Read the note on the table."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/537.gif[/img]

    Ruby examines the NOTE. It appears to be some kind of official document. Much of the text has been blotted out with a marker.

  "b": |-

    It won't work, the hole narrows at the end, and whatever's in there is wedged. It would need to be pulled out, and neither the cane nor the crowbar can GRAB.

    Tom offers to open the bottle of CHAMPAGNE with Ruby.

    Tom agrees. He was just trying to be upbeat.
    The champagne will taste all the better when they're out of here.

    Ruby inspects the objects on the wall. She finds, on the shelf, two WALKIE-TALKIES. Both Tom and Ruby take one.

    The metal shutters are bound tight with the coiled barbed wire. No amount of force from the crowbar will rip them free, and they can't be untied or unwound -- not with bare hands, at least.

    The door to the north, leading to the bombed-out room, is completely blocked with debris. Even Tom's manly physique wouldn't be able to clear a path.

    The stained wooden door to the west is locked. It appears to have a lock which is linked to the adjacent card reader.

    The room with Red's hideout and the monitors is blocked by a collapse of debris! Both that room and the room with the bomb are inaccessible, at least for now!

    The consensus seems to be either to go upstairs or go to the boarded-up hole in the other room.
    Who should go where? Remember, now that they have walkie-talkies they can split up and work faster while staying in touch!

    WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?

    Ruby examines the room:
    There is a ladder leading up, with a sealed metal hatch at the top and no visible means of opening it.
    There are two doors to the north, both with a symbol above them. 
    There is a FRAMED PICTURE on the wall, with some sort of illegible, archaic writing on it.
    To the east, there is a heavily-reinforced metal door with an inset card reader.

    There are two PLAQUES on the display case.
    The top one is illegible due to blood and rust. The second appears to be a request and/or warning label.
    A key card slot is set just underneath this second plaque.

    The door on the right is unlocked. It opens into a small closet. On the north wall is a large glass-front installment, like a vending machine, filled with all manner of pills and medicinal vials.
    There are two shelves here. On one shelf is a HIGH-TECH FIRST AID KIT. On the shelf above it is a PRESSURIZED OXYGEN TANK with an oxygen mask attached.

    There is a MEDICAL DIAGRAM on the wall above a stained MEDICAL EXAMINATION TABLE. On a small surface next to it is an ANATOMICAL EYE MODEL.

    Tom inspects the ANATOMICAL EYE MODEL, it's just a plastic standee model of an eyeball, like the kind they have in medical schools.
    HOWEVER! When Tom picks it up, he finds a single COIN underneath the base, which he then pockets.

    The DIAGRAM in the back is that of an eye with some sort of strange script annotating it. It seems very archaic.

    Tom picks up the PAPERS on the exam table...

    Tom unlocks the door. Tom and Ruby meet up again in the hall. 
    Tom makes sure Ruby is okay. He reassures her things will be all right.

    Ruby and Tom speak briefly. Tom explains the growing rift in the lower level. Ruby tells Tom about Stitches.

    Tom reacts strangely to the name. 
    When pressed, he explains he read it in a medical document.
    "Stitches" was officially recorded as dead.

    This is it. After that encounter with Stitches, Ruby knows she and Tom have to be 100% on the level. She can't keep it a secret anymore.

    She and Tom sit down by the door and she tells him everything.
    The documents about her own involvement in the study, labeling her "deceased", the visions of her own corpse, the injury she sustained from the abomination in the maintenance room, her encounters with Red...
    Even her third eye.

    She spills it all.
    She tells him everything.

    Ruby and Tom move on to explore the room.

    This room is full of broken science equipment, including shattered beakers and tubes, a broken table in the southeast corner, and lots of spilled liquid. The room spells of chemical vapors.
    Tom can see something vaguely through the steel vent, but it's too sturdy to bash down by brute force.
    There are scraps and tatters of cloth at Tom's feet. They look like the remnants of a labcoat.
    By a very LARGE CABINET (which is locked with a chain and padlock), Ruby finds a SEVERED FOOT on the ground, with minimal blood.
    The door has no visible lock, but is wired to the MONITOR.
    Ruby pockets the HEAVY GLOVES she finds on the floor.
    Also of obvious note in this room is the ACCESS HATCH leading down, which is secured in place with some sort of STAFF.

    Ruby grabs a piece of TATTERED CLOTH.

    Tom and Ruby uneasily put away the notes, unsure quite what to make of them, especially the last two entries. 
    They head down the hatch into the hallway below.
    Tom prepares to use the ACCESS CARD he got from the hole in the wall below.

    Ruby gives Tom the FIRST AID KIT, which Tom unlocks with the SEVERED FINGER.

    He empties it for its contents, which turn out to be:
    A pair of WIRE CUTTERS
    A ROLL OF GAUZE
    And a STRANGE DISC of green-dyed wood. It looks like it was broken off of something.

    Ruby's third eye hurts very badly. Her head is throbbing.

    Perhaps overusing it is a bad idea.

    Ruby radios Tom. 
    Tom says he's okay. He's exploring. He'll keep in touch. Ruby assures him she is fine too.
    Tom makes it clear he is still not in a very talkative mood.

    At least he was polite.

    Ruby checks the various lockers.
    Most of them are jammed shut, and locker #5 is wedged on its hinges. It looks like it was shut too tightly -- Ruby can't pull it open with her GIRLISH FIGURE.

    There is fresh blood on locker 2, however, and the locking mechanism seems to be open.
    Ruby considers whether to investigate.

    Ruby punches the locker to show it who's boss. Then she stands to one side and opens it...

    ...but it's empty, save for a small padlock key taped to the back wall. It looks very purposeful.

    Ruby peers down into the room below, where she first woke up.

    Tom's bloodied CROWBAR is there -- she must have missed it on her way to the cafeteria, because it's lying in the pit in the center of the room. Obviously, it's no longer stuck in Ace's leg.

    Ruby enters the hidden room.
    This room is divided into two main sections by a partition wall with no door, leaving both sections separated but accessible.
    It appears to be similar to the examination room downstairs, in some ways.

    An ACCESS HATCH leading up is sealed with a rather large mechanism, which is linked to a wall panel. 

    On the west portion of the room, there is a MEDICINE CABINET.

    The man holds his hands up in a gesture of surrender. 
    He looks oddly relieved, and sighs deeply.

    Ruby already HAS the cure. So does everyone else in this facility.
    It brought her SIGHT. It made her WELL. She didn't even need to EAT or DRINK.

    But when she died, she fucked it up.
    The cure was strong. It brought her BACK. And when she came back 
    she brought something with her.

    Filbert is the only one left untouched. He has to escape. He demands the PASSCODE.

    Filbert says Ruby has to stay here now.
    She can't go to the surface. She can't ESCAPE. She is INFECTED. She is BAD.

    He says he is the only one CLEAN. He is the only one who can ESCAPE. The others have damned themselves.
    He says ACE will get her. Ace won't listen to his orders anymore -- he won't even listen to HER. But he is still obedient. Filbert doesn't know who, but he knows he is still listening to SOMEONE.
    He says Ace will GET Ruby.

    Filbert, the "infection" on which even Filbert's account contradicts itself, Ace's obedience, and whoever SHE is. 
    Tom tells Ruby to go on ahead. There's something he needs to check first, but he'll meet up with her again shortly.

    It sounds as though Tom is ready to try working together again.

    The light fades from the room and darkness envelops Ruby and Tom. It is a familiar and horrible kind of darkness. 
    The unrelenting sound of moving water deafens their ears. 

    Neither Ruby nor Tom are exactly sure where each other are.

    Ruby closes her third eye and again the two of them consider the door to Lab B.

    Ruby has a very strong feeling that before all this is over, she'll have to go in there.

    Tom politely explains he doesn't feel like hugging Ruby right now, given the footage they watched together a short while ago. That hug didn't end particularly well.
    Maybe they just need some time to trust each other again.

    However, something seems to have changed.
  "n":

  "c": "Tom: Examine that thing you're standing on."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/824.gif[/img]

    It's that same severed foot from before. And Tom is gross for stepping on it.
  "n":

  "i": 825
- "d": 1498066761943
  "c": "Ruby, Tom: Go inside. Check out everything."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/826.gif[/img]

    Tom brings out the BLUDGEONY CANESHOVEL and the two of them enter the room.
    ...but it appears empty.
  "n":
  - 827
  "i": 826
- "d": 1498066761943
  "c": "Tom: Open those lockers."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/827.gif[/img]

    There is a patient's stool in the southwest corner. It doesn't open.
    Against the north wall in what appears to be the examination portion of the room, there is some sort of metal footlocker overgrown with fleshy protuberances.

    It resists Tom's attempts to open it, and two long, fleshy growths seem to converge where the lock would normally be, reaching towards each other with a gap in between.

    The entire thing seems like an amalgamation of skin, muscle, and vein.
  "n":

  "i": 827

  "c": "Tom: Check behind poster on wall. Also, look at your inventory."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/828.gif[/img]

    The EYE EXAM chart is bolted to the wall. It appears to be a permanent fixture.

    Ruby and Tom check their respective inventories.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Inspect hatch thoroughly."
  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/829.gif[/img]

    The keypad linked to the access hatch in the ceiling is a strange one. 
    It has a digit-lock AND a swipe-card slot, and it appears to be lacking power.

    Strangely, it is connected to the hatch with both an electric and apparently-organic cord. The fleshy cord reaches from one terminal to the hatch, as does an electrical wire. Crossing the electrical wire is a thing flap of burnt flesh and ash, which appears to be leading to the a set of contacts on the access card reader. 

    It seems rather complex. Whatever the case, the burnt flesh appears to be evidence that the two cords have trouble working well together.

    One of the doctors probably had a TINY KEY to go with this lock.

    Tom's no doctor, but he's got the prescription for this medicine cabinet!

    After bashing the cabinet open, Tom finds a large jar of TRANQUILIZER inside.
  "n":

  "i": 831
- "d": 1498067702370
  "c": "Tom: Fill syringe with tranquilizer."
  "b": |-
    Tom fills his SYRINGE with LIQUID TRANQUILIZER. He's got several doses worth in there now!
    Still, he considers how much good it would do against a behemoth like Ace, should he show up again.

    There appear to be three schools of thought on the fleshy locker. Should Tom:
    Cut the growths sealing the locker with the scalpel?
    Retrieve the fleshy growth from the jar downstairs and use it with the locker?
    Inject the growths with tranquilizer?

    Going by the first 5 responses, the majority is in favor of using the JAR GROWTH on the LOCKER GROWTHS.

    Tom and Ruby warily head back downstairs.

    Stitches lunges forward. His intentions are clearly hostile.

    He lets loose a pained moan as he staggers at Ruby, claws held high.

    Ruby trips Stitches with her UNATTRACTIVELY LONG FOOT. As soon as he falls, Tom pins him down using the strength of his MANLY PHYSIQUE and injects a healthy dose of LIQUID TRANQUILIZER into his neck.
    Tom keeps Stitches pinned until, after a very nerve-wracking minute or so, he finally goes unconscious.

  "b": |-
    [img]assets://mspfa/Ruby Quest/img/840.gif[/img]

    Stitches is carrying a TINY KEY labelled "medicine cabinet" in tiny letters. 
    ...Tom decides to leave it with him.

    Tom shoves Stitches into Locker #5 and slams the door close hard enough to jam it on the hinges. It's not much, but it'll do for now. It should keep him safe, and he should be out for a while with all the tranq Tom used.
  "n":

  "c": "Ruby: Give Stitches the group portrait."

    Ruby slips the GROUP PORTRAIT into a paper-thin gap in the locker's edge, at the top. Stitches may appreciate it, perhaps?

    Before Ruby's eyes, the fleshy growths grow together and coil into one another.

    The large fleshy mass Ruby placed onto the chest, now connected, begins to beat rhythmically, expanding and contracting with a soft, wet sound.

    A moment later, the lid of the locker opens up -- not from the edge, but from the center, peeling itself open.
    From inside, Ruby retrieves a FLESHY PROTOTUBE, a bizarre organic item that somehow features an electrical contact panel on one end.

    Filbert rushes at the two of them with his bonesaw. It's clear he isn't in any mood for discussion!

    Tom springs into action with his weapons at the ready. He will end this non-lethally, if he can.
    Filbert may be mutating rapidly, but Tom's MANLY PHYSIQUE is still more impressive than that of the good doctor.

    Filbert is too focused on his murderous rage to listen to reason. 
    It's also apparent that unlike Tom, he has no intention of ending this non-lethally.
    His mouth suddenly snaps open into a ferocious, gaping maw as he bellows out a shuddering roar.

    Neither Tom nor Ruby has any rope, and the only locker that would open is already jammed shut with Stitches inside.

    Ruby and Tom loot the BONESAW, but that's all Filbert seems to be carrying. Tom tells Ruby she should carry it, since she's lacking in weapons.
    They both check their inventories, then head back upstairs to the security room.

    Tom peers into the room ahead cautiously.

    There is a HUGE CONSOLE on the north wall. There's also a door beside it, a maintenance hatch on the east wall beside which are scattered MANY NOTES. There is also a piece of strange GREEN WOOD lying against the HUGE CONSOLE. 
    Finally, there appears to be an INTERCOM inset in the array of security monitoring equipment.

    Ruby adds the piece of GREEN WOOD to the shard she is already carrying. Like the other staff, it resembles a pattern she's seen somewhere else, but it's still missing a piece.

    Tom picks up the MANY NOTES and flips through a couple of them.

    The teeth-like things appear to be marks on where the operator should stand. They're right in front of an alphanumeric keypad, the only set of controls on the entire console Ruby would know how to use.

    Tom tries the hatch, but it's stuck tight. A small LED readout below it reads "OVERRIDE ACTIVE, ACCESS DENIED"

    Tom attempts to make contact with whoever's on the other end.

    A strangely familiar voice fires off a litany of incredibly foul (and very unprovoked) profanities directed at Tom.

    Tom pauses momentarily, stunned by the response. Just as he attempts to explain his situation, a strange crunching sound -- like something being eaten -- comes from the other end, followed by static.

    It would appear the line is now dead.

    The unhealthy-looking figure hooked up to the wall introduces herself as "Bella".

    She says she is very sorry, but she can't let you leave.
    She goes on to say she has top priority control of every security system in the facility and she has instituted a lockdown.

    Ruby joins Tom and attempts to convince Bella to let them out.
    Bella explains that she is not in charge here. She is merely acting on orders her superiors issued before they abandoned the facility.
    She simply cannot open the surface hatch for them. Those are her orders.

    Tom menaces for a moment, and Bella responds that she will not fight him.

    Bella is kept on life support. Those things don't attack her. Her mind must be intact for her to continue operating. She suspects they don't want to taint it with her running the facility's systems.

    A very angry-sounding thumping noise shakes the ground in frustrated peals and an echoing, eerie voice comes from the lower levels.

    She has asked nicely, she has helped them come this far, but now she is putting her foot down. She will lock doors, activate traps, and seal rooms if they persist.

    Ruby and Tom descend to the cafeteria room, passing through the upstairs thoroughfare on the way.

    Tom moves to take the top off the water cooler so they can look inside.

    Stashed inside the cooler itself is an oddly-shaped shard of GREEN WOOD.
    Ruby adds the last piece and assembles the second GREEN STAFF.

    Should they head upstairs to the locker now, or should they check the nearby backup console first?

    Early consensus was on console.
    It's a moot point anyway, since the console doesn't seem to have power. There's still a familiar symbol hanging above it.

    Tom and Ruby head back upstairs, making the trek to the room directly above them, since they have no means to climb the hole in the ceiling.

    Ruby places the GREEN STAFF in the carved recesses on the locker's face.

    The locker's door swings open, revealing a switch to match the one in the other locker they'd opened with the first GREEN STAFF.

    Ruby figures she might as well pull this switch, too.

    The locker on the left appears to be sealed. The one on the right is bent and partially melted in places, and appears to be simply jammed shut. Not even Tom can force it open, and its hinges appear to have been messed with as well.

    Ruby rationalizes they must be the two missing lockers -- the ones from the room where she woke up. <meta name="theme-color" content="#900000">

    Tom and Ruby escape from Ace's lair in cold storage. They seal the area behind them, but knowing Ace, it won't hold him for long. Whatever they're going to do, they had better do it FAST. Ace is clearly on a mission and this facility will not be safe for them for very much longer. 

    Tom's MANLY PHYSIQUE allows him to carry the prisoner with relative ease, but his move speed is still reduced. Perhaps things would move faster if he and Ruby split up.

    Remember, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE! 
    Go!

    Tom begins to carry their new acquaintance upstairs, making his way to the surface access hatch.

    Ruby jumps down into the room below, trying to reach the symbol-laden clock downstairs as quickly as possible.

    It's only a matter of time until Ace escapes again, and he'll be looking for them.

    Ruby lands safely in the room below.
    The backup console here is still not receiving power.

    She quickly heads downstairs to the clock dial, now that she's recovered the wooden EYE PEG.

    Good idea. Ruby and Tom both make sure their radios are on.

    Ruby quickly climbs down into the brig, which is still as broken as ever, and darts into the side room.
    There, she finally replaces the wooden EYE PEG and dials it to the symbol that corresponds to the console she used when she first woke up.

    While Ruby waits for the system to respond, Tom runs into FILBERT. Apparently he shook off a massive dose of tranquilizer rather quickly. He menaces with spikes of flesh at Tom. He seems even more ravenously determined than last time, eager to rip Tom to pieces.

    This is the last thing he needed. He's got to get to the exit.
    Tom doesn't fucking have TIME for this!

    Ruby tears ass to get upstairs as fast as possible. As she climbs up the thoroughfare ladder, she hears the door to the cells being opened.

    Ace won't be far behind, and from the loud noises of him slamming around, he seems ANGRY.

    Ruby finally reaches the upper level and bursts into the security room, only to find a monstrously gigantic, fleshy abomination covered in eyes, looking like a huge and horribly mutated version of Subject Six.
    It appears to be cowering in the corner, and doesn't seem to notice Ruby.

    Out of pity, Ruby tries to call to Subject Six, but it's no good. He sits shivering in his grief, muttering to himself in fear of Ace.

    Ruby enters the Lobby. The ex-prisoner seems to have regained some of his motor skills and is shakily climbing the now-open ladder upwards. Tom says his name is "Jay".

    Tom is visibly shaken. If that giant monster is afraid of Ace, he doesn't stand a chance, even if he were to manage another burst of adrenaline.

    There is now a very serious problem. Ace will be here in a matter of seconds. There's no time for them to get to the surface and close the hatch.

    Tom takes a moment to reflect on how tragic it is that sometimes actions have to have consequences, good or bad. 

    Ruby is relieved beyond words that Tom made it up. She's also glad she saw him coming up before she slammed the hatch shut.

    Well, that's the true end, everyone. 
    I hope you had as much fun playing as I did running this little campaign for you.

    It's been a long run but it's finally over. All stories have to come to an end sooner or later.

    Thanks for your patience, your support, and your encouragement. It's been a blast.

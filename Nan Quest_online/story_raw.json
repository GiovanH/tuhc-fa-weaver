He's been here the longest, he must have some insight. \n\nHe takes a puff and begins. \nThe Hotel was built only recently, at least for him, he says. The spot of land it was built on has been open for a long time. Before that, when he was a kid, he remembers the remnants of a Spanish Mission, but it was gone long before. \nAs for the place itself, it's hard to understand. Everything seems to be moving around and changing. It's hard to rely on anything. He says he's tried the doors and windows enough times to know they don't open, except to lead somewhere you probably don't want to be. But never out. \nThe courtyard at the center of the hotel has some windows opening to it but he's never tried crossing over into it, because that's where the Beast lives. A huge animal, as black as night, feral and vicious. Cold and unthinking. It comes into the Hotel sometimes -- he's seen it twice inside now, he says. \nHe states again light seems to be their only true defense from the three primary threats here. \nHe's stockpiled some food here from the kitchen and janitor's closet, and they have little in the way of defense. [color=#a00000]Anna[/color] has a kitchen knife, [color=#088000]Kim[/color] has a taser she brought here, [color=#808000]Henry[/color] has a club made from a chair leg, and [color=#af5000]Anderson[/color] himself carries a revolver with a few shots remaining. \nAs for [color=#808080]Nan[/color]'s inquiry about items, he says that he has a few, and no offense intended to the little lady, but he feels more comfortable holding onto them himself than giving them to a stranger.",
